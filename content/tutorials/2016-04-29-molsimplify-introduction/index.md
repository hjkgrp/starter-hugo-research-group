[molSimplify](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jcc.24437/full) is an open source Python code that enables high-throughput screening in inorganic chemistry. It generates high-quality geometries of transition metal complexes for use as input in electronic structure calculations. Our trained neural network can also predict certain quantum mechanical properties at near-zero cost.


A diverse array of metals, ligands and coordination geometries are supported. Further, the code can also functionalize a more complex structure (e.g. a porphyrin or other metal-ligand complex) by including additional ligands or replacing existing ones.


The user can specify many options either from the commandline or using an input file. Alternatively, molSimplify also includes a Graphical User Interface (GUI) that can be used to access some functionality in a user-friendly manner. Click [here](../2021-10-27-installing-molsimplify/) for installation instructions, and refer to our [tutorials](../../molsimplify-tutorials/) for demonstrations of how to use key features.


A set of generated files used for benchmarking molSimplify in our publication is available for [download](coords-outputfiles.zip). This folder provides `.xyz` coordinate files and Terachem output files a variety of structures. Note that with gradual improvements to the code, structures generated by the latest version will be different, and in many cases, much better.
