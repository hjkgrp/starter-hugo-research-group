abstract: Understanding complex biological systems requires the system-wide characterization
  of both molecular and cellular features. Existing methods for spatial mapping of
  biomolecules in intact tissues suffer from information loss caused by degradation
  and tissue damage. We report a tissue transformation strategy named stabilization
  under harsh conditions via intramolecular epoxide linkages to prevent degradation
  (SHIELD), which uses a flexible polyepoxide to form controlled intra- and intermolecular
  cross-link with biomolecules. SHIELD preserves protein fluorescence and antigenicity,
  transcripts and tissue architecture under a wide range of harsh conditions. We applied
  SHIELD to interrogate system-level wiring, synaptic architecture, and molecular
  features of virally labeled neurons and their targets in mouse at single-cell resolution.
  We also demonstrated rapid three-dimensional phenotyping of core needle biopsies
  and human brain cells. SHIELD enables rapid, multiscale, integrated molecular phenotyping
  of both animal and clinical tissues.
