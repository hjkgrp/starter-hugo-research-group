abstract: 'Anthropogenic emissions of N<sub>2</sub>O, the third most abundant greenhouse gas after CO<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub>, are contributing to global climate change. Although metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have been widely studied as adsorbents for CO<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub>, less effort has focused on the use of MOFs to remove N<sub>2</sub>O from emission streams or from air. Further, N<sub>2</sub>O activation would enable its use as an inexpensive oxidant for fine chemical synthesis. Herein, we identify features that contribute to strong binding and high uptake of N<sub>2</sub>O at coorinatively unsaturated metal sites in the M<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>(btdd) (M= Mn, Co, Ni, Cu; btdd<sup>2–</sup> = bis(1,2,3-triazolo[4,5-b],[4′,5′-i])dibenzo[1,4]dioxin) and M<sub>2</sub>(dobdc) (M = Mg, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn; dobdc<sup>4−</sup> = 2,5-dioxido-1,4-benzenedicarboxylate) series of MOFs. Combined experimental and computational studies suggest that N<sub>2</sub>O adsorption at open-metal-sites is primarily based on electrostatic interactions, rather than π-backbonding, causing MOFs with more Lewis acidic metal centers to be superior N<sub>2</sub>2O adsorbents. As a result, Mg<sub>2</sub>(dobdc) demonstrates strong binding and record-setting N<sub>2</sub>O uptake (8.75 mmol/g at 1 bar and 298 K). Using density functional theory (DFT) to characterize reactive intermediates and transition states, we demonstrate that N<sub>2</sub>O activation to form a M(IV)-oxo species and N<sub>2</sub> is thermodynamically favorable in Mn<sub>2</sub>(dobdc) and Fe<sub>2</sub>(dobdc) but appears to be kinetically limited in Mn<sub>2</sub>(dobdc). Our work lays a foundation for understanding N2O adsorption and activation in MOFs, paving the way for the design of promising next-generation materials for N<sub>2</sub>O capture and utilization.'
