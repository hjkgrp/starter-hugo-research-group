abstract  ="Anthropogenic emissions of N2O{,} the third most abundant greenhouse gas after CO2 and CH4{,} are contributing to global climate change. Although metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) have been widely studied as adsorbents for CO2 and CH4{,} less effort has focused on the use of MOFs to remove N2O from emission streams or from air. Further{,} N2O activation would enable its use as an inexpensive oxidant for fine chemical synthesis. Herein{,} we identify features that contribute to strong binding and high uptake of N2O at coordinatively unsaturated metal sites in the M2Cl2(btdd) (M = Mn{,} Co{,} Ni{,} Cu; btdd2− = bis(1{,}2{,}3-triazolo[4{,}5-b]{,}[4′{,}5′-i])dibenzo[1{,}4]dioxin) and M2(dobdc) (M = Mg{,} Mn{,} Fe{,} Co{,} Ni{,} Cu{,} Zn; dobdc4− = 2{,}5-dioxido-1{,}4-benzenedicarboxylate) series of MOFs. Combined experimental and computational studies suggest that N2O adsorption at open-metal-sites is primarily based on electrostatic interactions{,} rather than π-backbonding{,} causing MOFs with more Lewis acidic metal centers to be superior N2O adsorbents. As a result{,} Mg2(dobdc) demonstrates strong binding and record-setting N2O uptake (8.75 mmol g−1 at 1 bar and 298 K). Using density functional theory (DFT) to characterize reactive intermediates and transition states{,} we demonstrate that N2O activation to form a M(iv)–oxo species and N2 is thermodynamically favorable in Mn2(dobdc) and Fe2(dobdc) but appears to be kinetically limited in Mn2(dobdc). Our work lays a foundation for understanding N2O adsorption and activation in MOFs{,} paving the way for the design of promising next-generation materials for N2O capture and utilization."}
