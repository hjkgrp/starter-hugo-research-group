abstract: We report a workflow and the output of a natural language processing (NLP)-based
  procedure to mine the extant metal–organic framework (MOF) literature describing
  structurally characterized MOFs and their solvent removal and thermal stabilities.
  We obtain over 2,000 solvent removal stability measures from text mining and 3,000
  thermal decomposition temperatures from thermogravimetric analysis data. We assess
  the validity of our NLP methods and the accuracy of our extracted data by comparing
  to a hand-labeled subset. Machine learning (ML, i.e. artificial neural network)
  models trained on this data using graph- and pore-geometry-based representations
  enable prediction of stability on new MOFs with quantified uncertainty. Our web
  interface, MOFSimplify, provides users access to our curated data and enables them
  to harness that data for predictions on new MOFs. MOFSimplify also encourages community
  feedback on existing data and on ML model predictions for community-based active
  learning for improved MOF stability models.
