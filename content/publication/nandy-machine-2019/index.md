abstract: Metal–oxo moieties are important catalytic intermediates in the selective
  partial oxidation of hydrocarbons and in water splitting. Stable metal–oxo species
  have reactive properties that vary depending on the spin state of the metal, complicating
  the development of structure–property relationships. To overcome these challenges,
  we train machine-learning (ML) models capable of predicting metal–oxo formation
  energies across a range of first-row metals, oxidation states, and spin states.
  Using connectivity-only features tailored for inorganic chemistry as inputs to kernel
  ridge regression or artificial neural network (ANN) ML models, we achieve good mean
  absolute errors (4–5 kcal/mol) on set-aside test data across a range of ligand orientations.
  Analysis of feature importance for oxo formation energy prediction reveals the dominance
  of nonlocal, electronic ligand properties in contrast to other transition metal
  complex properties (e.g., spin-state or ionization potential). We enumerate the
  theoretical catalyst space with an ANN, revealing expected trends in oxo formation
  energetics, such as destabilization of the metal–oxo species with increasing d-filling,
  as well as exceptions, such as weak correlations with indicators of oxidative stability
  of the metal in the resting state or unexpected spin-state dependence in reactivity.
  We carry out uncertainty-aware evolutionary optimization using the ANN to explore
  a textgreater37 000 candidate catalyst space. New metal and oxidation state combinations
  are uncovered and validated with density functional theory (DFT), including counterintuitive
  oxo formation energies for oxidatively stable complexes. This approach doubles the
  density of confirmed DFT leads in originally sparsely populated regions of property
  space, highlighting the potential of ML-model-driven discovery to uncover catalyst
  design rules and exceptions.
