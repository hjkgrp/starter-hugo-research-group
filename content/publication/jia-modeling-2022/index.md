abstract: Doped graphitic single-atom catalysts (SACs) with isolated iron sites have
  similarities to natural enzymes and molecular biomimetics that can convert methane
  to methanol via a radical rebound mechanism with high-valent Fe(IV) O intermediates.
  To understand the relationship of SACs to these homogeneous analogues, we use range-separated
  hybrid density functional theory (DFT) to compare the energetics and structure of
  the direct metal-coordinating environment in the presence of 2p (i.e., N or O) and
  3p (i.e., P or S) dopants and with increasing finite graphene model flake size to
  mimic differences in local rigidity. While metal–ligand bond lengths in SACs are
  significantly shorter than those in transition-metal complexes, they remain longer
  than SAC mimic macrocyclic complexes. In SACs or the macrocyclic complexes, this
  compressed metal–ligand environment induces metal distortion out of the plane, especially
  when reactive species are bound to iron. As a result of this modified metal-coordination
  environment, we observe SACs to simultaneously favor the formation of the metal–oxo
  while also allowing for methanol release. This reactivity is different from what
  has been observed for large sets of square planar model homogeneous catalysts. Overall,
  our calculations recommend broader consideration of dopants (e.g., P or S) and processing
  conditions that allow for local distortion around the metal site in graphitic SACs.
