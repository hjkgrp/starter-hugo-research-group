abstract: Escalating global water scarcity necessitates high-performance desalination
  membranes, for which fundamental understanding of structure–property–performance
  relationships is required. In this study, we comprehensively assess the ionization
  behavior of nanoporous polyamide selective layers in state-of-the-art nanofiltration
  (NF) membranes. In these films, residual carboxylic acids and amines influence permeability
  and selectivity by imparting hydrophilicity and ionizable moieties that can exclude
  coions. We utilize layered interfacial polymerization to prepare physically and
  chemically similar selective layers of controlled thickness. We then demonstrate
  location-dependent ionization of carboxyl groups in NF polyamide films. Specifically,
  only surface carboxyl groups ionize under neutral pH, whereas interior carboxyl
  ionization requires pH textgreater9. Conversely, amine ionization behaves invariably
  across the film. First-principles simulations reveal that the low permittivity of
  nanoconfined water drives the anomalous carboxyl ionization behavior. Furthermore,
  we report that interior carboxyl ionization could improve the water–salt permselectivity
  of NF membranes over fourfold, suggesting that interior charge density could be
  an important tool to enhance the selectivity of polyamide membranes. Our findings
  highlight the influence of nanoconfinement on membrane transport properties and
  provide enhanced fundamental understanding of ionization that could enable novel
  membrane design.
