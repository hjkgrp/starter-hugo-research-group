abstract: Biological systems rely on recyclable materials resources such as amino
  acids, carbohydrates and nucleic acids. When biomaterials are damaged as a result
  of aging or stress, tissues undergo repair by a depolymerization–repolymerization
  sequence of remodelling. Integration of this concept into synthetic materials systems
  may lead to devices with extended lifetimes. Here, we show that a metastable polymer,
  end-capped poly(o-phthalaldehyde), undergoes mechanically initiated depolymerization
  to revert the material to monomers. Trapping experiments and steered molecular dynamics
  simulations are consistent with a heterolytic scission mechanism. The obtained monomer
  was repolymerized by a chemical initiator, effectively completing a depolymerization–repolymerization
  cycle. By emulating remodelling of biomaterials, this model system suggests the
  possibility of smart materials where aging or mechanical damage triggers depolymerization,
  and orthogonal conditions regenerate the polymer when and where necessary.
