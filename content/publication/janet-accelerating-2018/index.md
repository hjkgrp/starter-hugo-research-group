abstract: Machine learning (ML) has emerged as a powerful complement to simulation
  for materials discovery by reducing time for evaluation of energies and properties
  at accuracy competitive with first-principles methods. We use genetic algorithm
  (GA) optimization to discover unconventional spin-crossover complexes in combination
  with efficient scoring from an artificial neural network (ANN) that predicts spin-state
  splitting of inorganic complexes. We explore a compound space of over 5600 candidate
  materials derived from eight metal/oxidation state combinations and a 32-ligand
  pool. We introduce a strategy for error-aware ML-driven discovery by limiting how
  far the GA travels away from the nearest ANN training points while maximizing property
  (i.e., spin-splitting) fitness, leading to discovery of 80% of the leads from full
  chemical space enumeration. Over a 51-complex subset, average unsigned errors (4.5
  kcal/mol) are close to the ANNâ€™s baseline 3 kcal/mol error. By obtaining leads from
  the trained ANN within seconds rather than days from a DFT-driven GA, this strategy
  demonstrates the power of ML for accelerating inorganic material discovery.
