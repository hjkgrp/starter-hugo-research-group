abstract: The enzyme trans-4-Hydroxy-L-proline (Hyp) dehydratase (HypD) is among the
  most abundant glycyl radical enzymes (GREs) in the healthy human gut microbiome
  and is considered a promising antibiotic target for the prominent antibiotic-resistant
  pathogen Clostridium difficile. Although an enzymatic mechanism has been proposed,
  the role of the greater HypD protein environment in mediating radical reactivity
  is not well understood. To fill this gap in understanding, we investigate HypD across
  multiple time- and length- scales using electronic structure modeling and classical
  molecular dynamics. We observe that the Hyp substrate protonation state significantly
  alters both its enzyme-free reactivity and its dynamics within the enzyme active
  site. Accurate coupled cluster modeling suggests the deprotonated form of Hyp to
  be the most reactive protonation state for C5–Hpro-S activation. In the protein
  environment, hydrophobic interactions modulate the positioning of Cys434 radical
  to enhance the reactivity of C5–Hpro-S abstraction. Long-time dynamics reveal that
  changing Hyp protonation states triggers the switching of a Leu643-gated water tunnel,
  a functional feature that has not yet been observed for members of the GRE superfamily.
