    abstract = { Mononuclear Fe enzymes such as heme-containing cytochrome P450 enzymes catalyze a variety of C–H activation reactions under ambient conditions, and they represent an attractive platform for engineering reactivity through changes to the native enzyme. Using density functional theory, we study both native Fe and non-native group 8 (Ru, Os) and group 9 (Ir) metal centers in an active site model of P450. We quantify how changing the metal changes spin state preferences throughout the catalytic cycle. Our calculations reveal an intermediate-spin ground state for all Fe intermediates while the heavier metals prefer low-spin ground states across most intermediates in the reaction cycle. We also study the rate-determining hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) step and the subsequent rebound step. We observe comparable HAT barriers for Fe and Ru, a much higher barrier for Os, and the lowest HAT barrier for Ir. Rebound steps are barrierless for all metals, and the rebound intermediate for Fe is most significantly stabilized. Examination of ground spin states of all intermediates in the reaction cycle reveals spin-allowed pathways for the group 8 metals and spin-forbidden energetics for the group 9 Ir with potential two-state reactivity. Our work highlights the differences between the group 8 metals and the group 9 Ir, and it suggests that engineered P450 enzymes with Ru in particular result in improved enzyme reactivity toward C–H hydroxylation. }
