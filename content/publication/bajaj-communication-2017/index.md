abstract: 'The flat-plane condition is the union of two exact constraints in electronic
  structure theory: (i) energetic piecewise linearity with fractional electron removal
  or addition and (ii) invariant energetics with change in electron spin in a half
  filled orbital. Semi-local density functional theory (DFT) fails to recover the
  flat plane, exhibiting convex fractional charge errors (FCE) and concave fractional
  spin errors (FSE) that are related to delocalization and static correlation errors.
  We previously showed that DFT+U eliminates FCE but now demonstrate that, like other
  widely employed corrections (i.e., Hartree-Fock exchange), it worsens FSE. To find
  an alternative strategy, we examine the shape of semi-local DFT deviations from
  the exact flat plane and we find this shape to be remarkably consistent across ions
  and molecules. We introduce the judiciously modified DFT (jmDFT) approach, wherein
  corrections are constructed from few-parameter, low-order functional forms that
  fit the shape of semi-local DFT errors. We select one such physically intuitive
  form and incorporate it self-consistently to correct semi-local DFT. We demonstrate
  on model systems that jmDFT represents the first easy-to-implement, no-overhead
  approach to recovering the flat plane from semi-local DFT.'
