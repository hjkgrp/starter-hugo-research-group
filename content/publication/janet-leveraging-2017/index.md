abstract: Virtual high throughput screening, typically driven by first-principles,
  density functional theory calculations, has emerged as a powerful tool for the discovery
  of new materials. Although the computational materials science community has benefited
  from open source tools for the rapid structure generation, calculation, and analysis
  of crystalline inorganic materials, software and strategies to address the unique
  challenges of inorganic complex discovery have not been as widely available. We
  present a unified view of our recent developments in the open source molSimplify
  code for inorganic discovery. Building on our previous efforts in the automated
  generation of highly accurate inorganic molecular structures, first-principles simulation,
  and property analysis to accelerate high-throughput screening, we have recently
  incorporated a neural network that both improves structure generation and predicts
  electronic properties prior to first-principles calculation. We also provide an
  overview of how multimillion molecule organic libraries can be leveraged for inorganic
  discovery alongside cheminformatics concepts of molecular diversity in order to
  efficiently traverse chemical space. We demonstrate all of these tools on the discovery
  of design rules for octahedral Fe(II/III) redox couples with nitrogen ligands. Over
  a search of only approximately 40 new molecules, we obtain redox potentials relative
  to the Fc/Fc+ couple ranging from âˆ’1 to 4.5 V in aqueous solution. Our new automated
  correlation analysis reveals heteroatom identity and the degree of structural branching
  to be key ligand descriptors in determining redox potential. This inorganic discovery
  toolkit provides a promising approach to advancing transition metal complex design.
