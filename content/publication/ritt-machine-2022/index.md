abstract: ' Designing single-species selective membranes for high-precision separations
  requires a fundamental understanding of the molecular interactions governing solute
  transport. Here, we comprehensively assess molecular-level features that influence
  the separation of 18 different anions by nanoporous cellulose acetate membranes.
  Our analysis identifies the limitations of bulk solvation characteristics to explain
  ion transport, highlighted by the poor correlation between hydration energy and
  the measured permselectivity (R2 = 0.37). Entropy-enthalpy compensation, spanning
  40 kilojoules per mole, leads to a free-energy barrier (∆G‡) variation of only ~8
  kilojoules per mole across all anions. We apply machine learning to elucidate descriptors
  for energetic barriers from a set of 126 collected features. Notably, electrostatic
  features account for 75% of the overall features used to describe ∆G‡, despite the
  relatively uncharged state of cellulose acetate. Our work presents an approach for
  studying ion transport across nanoporous membranes that could enable the design
  of ion-selective membranes.'
