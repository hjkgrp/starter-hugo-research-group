abstract: 'Second row elements in small- and medium-rings modulate strain. Herein we report the synthesis of two novel oligosilyl-containing cycloalkynes that exhibit angle-strain, as observed by X-ray crystallography. However, the angle-strained sila-cyclooctynes are sluggish participants in cycloadditions with benzyl azide. A distortion-interaction model analysis based on density functional theory calculations was performed.'
