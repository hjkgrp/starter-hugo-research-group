abstract  ="Second row elements in small- and medium-rings modulate strain. Herein we report the synthesis of two novel oligosilyl-containing cycloalkynes that exhibit angle-strain{,} as observed by X-ray crystallography. However{,} the angle-strained sila-cyclooctynes are sluggish participants in cycloadditions with benzyl azide. A distortion-interaction model analysis based on density functional theory calculations was performed."}
