abstract: Computational high-throughput screening is an essential tool for catalyst
  design, limited primarily by the efficiency with which accurate predictions can
  be made. In bulk heterogeneous catalysis, linear free energy relationships (LFERs)
  have been extensively developed to relate elementary step activation energies, and
  thus overall catalytic activity, back to the adsorption energies of key intermediates,
  dramatically reducing the computational cost of screening. The applicability of
  these LFERs to single-site catalysts remains unclear, owing to the directional,
  covalent metal–ligand bonds and the broader chemical space of accessible ligand
  scaffolds. Through a computational screen of nearly 500 model Fe(II) complexes for
  CH4 hydroxylation, we observe that (1) tuning ligand field strength yields LFERs
  by comparably shifting energetics of the metal 3d levels that govern the stability
  of different intermediates and (2) distortion of the metal coordination geometry
  breaks these LFERs by increasing the splitting between the dxz/dyz and dz2 metal
  states that govern reactivity. Thus, in single-site catalysts, low Brønsted–Evans–Polanyi
  slopes for oxo formation, which would limit peak turnover frequency achievable through
  ligand field tuning alone, can be overcome through structural distortions achievable
  in experimentally characterized compounds. Observations from this screen also motivate
  the placement of strong HB donors in targeted positions as a scaffold-agnostic strategy
  for further activity improvement. More generally, our findings motivate broader
  variation of coordination geometries in reactivity studies with single-site catalysts.
