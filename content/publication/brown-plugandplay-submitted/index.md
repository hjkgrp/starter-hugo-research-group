abstract: 'The immobilization of homogeneous catalysts onto solid supports to improve
  recyclability while maintaining catalytic efficiency is often a trial-and-error
  process limited by poor control of the local catalyst environment and few strategies
  to append catalysts to support materials. Here, we introduce a modular heterogenous
  catalysis platform that addresses these challenges. Our approach leverages the well-defined
  interiors of self-assembled Pd12L24 metal–organic cages/polyhedra (MOCs): through
  a combination of catalyst-ligands, polymeric ligands, and spacer ligands, we demonstrate
  facile self-assembly of novel acetylene-linked Pd12L24-crosslinked polymer gels
  featuring endohedrally-catalyst-functionalized junctions. Semi-empirical calculations
  show that catalyst incorporation into these MOC junctions does not affect their
  geometry, giving rise to well-defined nanoconfined catalyst domains as confirmed
  experimentally using electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. Given the unique
  network topology of these freestanding gels, they are mechanically robust regardless
  of their endohedral catalyst composition, allowing them to be physically manipulated
  and transferred from one reaction to another to achieve multiple rounds of catalysis.
  Moreover, by decoupling the catalyst environment (interior of MOC junctions) from
  the physical properties of the support (the elastic polymer matrix), this strategy
  enables catalysis in environments where homogeneous catalyst analogs are not viable,
  as demonstrated for the Au(I)-catalyzed cyclization of 4-pentynoic acid in aqueous
  media.'
