abstract: Redox species have been explored extensively for catalysis, energy storage,
  and molecular recognition. It is shown that nanostructured pseudocapacitive electrodes
  functionalized with ferrocene-based redox polymers are an attractive platform for
  the selective sorptive separation of dilute organic anions from strong aqueous and
  organic electrolyte solutions, and subsequent release of the sorbed ions to a stripping
  phase through electrochemical control of the specific binding processes. A remarkable
  degree of selectivity is shown for carboxylates (–COO–), sulfonates (–SO3−), and
  phosphonates (–PO3−2) over inorganic anions such as PF6− and ClO4− (separation factor
  textgreater140 in aqueous and textgreater3000 in organic systems), and between carboxylates
  with various substituents, based on differences in electronic structure and density
  of the adsorbates, beyond size, and charge. Our organometallic redox electrodes
  are a promising platform for targeting aqueous and organic systems requiring high
  separation factors and fast throughput, such as in the recovery of value-added products
  from organic synthesis and isolation of dilute yet highly toxic organic contaminants.
  The combination of spectroscopic experiments and quantum chemistry sheds light on
  a selective binding mechanism based on redox-enhanced hydrogen bonding between the
  cyclopentadienyl ligand and the carboxylate functional group, with broader implications
  for molecular design, supramolecular recognition, and metallocene catalysis.
