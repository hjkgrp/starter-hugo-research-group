abstract: 'The predictive accuracy of density functional theory (DFT) is hampered
  by delocalization errors, especially for correlated systems such as transition-metal
  complexes. Two complementary strategies have been developed to reduce delocalization
  error: eliminating the global curvature with change in charge and computing a linear
  response Hubbard U as a measure of local curvature at the metal center at fixed
  charge and applying it to the transition-metal complex in a DFT+U framework. We
  investigate the relationship between the two delocalization error measures as the
  ligand field strength is varied with the number of strong-field ligands in a series
  of heteroleptic complexes or by geometrically constraining the metalâ€“ligand bond
  length in homoleptic octahedral complexes. We show that across these sets of complexes
  an inverse relationship generally exists between global and local curvatures. We
  find that effects of ligand substitution on both measures of delocalization are
  typically additive, but the quantities seldom coincide.'
