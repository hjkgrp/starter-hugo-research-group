abstract: ' Approximate semilocal density functional theory (DFT) is known to underestimate
  surface formation energies yet paradoxically overbind adsorbates on catalytic transition-metal
  oxide surfaces due to delocalization error. The low-cost DFT + U approach only improves
  surface formation energies for early transition-metal oxides or adsorption energies
  for late transition-metal oxides. In this work, we demonstrate that this inefficacy
  arises due to the conventional usage of metal-centered atomic orbitals as projectors
  within DFT + U. We analyze electron density rearrangement during surface formation
  and O atom adsorption on rutile transition-metal oxides to highlight that a standard
  DFT + U correction fails to tune properties when the corresponding density rearrangement
  is highly delocalized across both metal and oxygen sites. To improve both surface
  properties simultaneously while retaining the simplicity of a single-site DFT +
  U correction, we systematically construct multi-atom-centered molecular-orbital-like
  projectors for DFT + U. We demonstrate this molecular DFT + U approach for tuning
  adsorption energies and surface formation energies of minimal two-dimensional models
  of representative early (i.e., TiO2) and late (i.e., PtO2) transition-metal oxides.
  Molecular DFT + U simultaneously corrects adsorption energies and surface formation
  energies of multilayer models of rutile TiO2(110) and PtO2(110) to resolve the paradoxical
  description of surface stability and surface reactivity of semilocal DFT.'
