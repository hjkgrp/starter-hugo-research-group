abstract: ' The isonitrile moiety is an electron-rich functionality that decorates
  various bioactive natural products isolated from diverse kingdoms of life. Isonitrile
  biosynthesis was restricted for over a decade to isonitrile synthases, a family
  of enzymes catalyzing a condensation reaction between l-Trp/l-Tyr and ribulose-5-phosphate.
  The discovery of ScoE, a non-heme iron(II) and Î±-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase,
  demonstrated an alternative pathway employed by nature for isonitrile installation.
  Biochemical, crystallographic, and computational investigations of ScoE have previously
  been reported, yet the isonitrile formation mechanism remains obscure. In the present
  work, we employed in vitro biochemistry, chemical synthesis, spectroscopy techniques,
  and computational simulations that enabled us to propose a plausible molecular mechanism
  for isonitrile formation. Our findings demonstrate that the ScoE reaction initiates
  with C5 hydroxylation of (R)-3-((carboxymethyl)amino)butanoic acid to generate 1,
  which undergoes dehydration, presumably mediated by Tyr96 to synthesize 2 in a trans
  configuration. (R)-3-isocyanobutanoic acid is finally generated through radical-based
  decarboxylation of 2, instead of the common hydroxylation pathway employed by this
  enzyme superfamily.'
