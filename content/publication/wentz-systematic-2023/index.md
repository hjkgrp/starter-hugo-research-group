abstract: 'Four unsaturated poly(carbooligosilane)s (**P1–P4**) were prepared via acyclic diene metathesis polycondensation of new oligosilane diene monomers (**1–4**). These novel polymers with varying main-chain Si incorporation have high trans internal olefin stereochemistry (ca. 80%) and molecular weights (9500–21,700 g mol<sup>–1</sup>). Postpolymerization epoxidation converted all alkene moieties to epoxides and rendered the polymers (**P5–P8**) more electrophilic, which allowed for single-molecule force spectroscopy studies via a modified atomic force microscope setup with a silicon tip and cantilever. The single-chain elasticity of the polycarbooligosilanes decreased with increasing numbers of Si–Si bonds, a finding reproduced by quantum chemical calculations.'
