abstract: An extensive redistribution of spin density in TBrPP-Co molecules adsorbed
  on a Cu(111) surface is investigated by monitoring Kondo resonances at different
  locations on single molecules. Remarkably, the width of the Kondo resonance is found
  to be much larger on the organic ligands than on the central cobalt atomâ€”reflecting
  enhanced spin-electron interactions on molecular orbitals. This unusual effect is
  explained by means of first-principles and numerical renormalization-group calculations
  highlighting the possibility to engineer spin polarization by exploiting interfacial
  charge transfer.
