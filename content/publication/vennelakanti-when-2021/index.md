abstract: Hydrogen bonds (HBs) play an essential role in the structure and catalytic
  action of enzymes, but a complete understanding of HBs in proteins challenges the
  resolution of modern structural (i.e., X-ray diffraction) techniques and mandates
  computationally demanding electronic structure methods from correlated wavefunction
  theory for predictive accuracy. Numerous amino acid sidechains contain functional
  groups (e.g., hydroxyls in Ser/Thr or Tyr and amides in Asn/Gln) that can act as
  either HB acceptors or donors (HBA/HBD) and even form simultaneous, ambifunctional
  HB interactions. To understand the relative energetic benefit of each interaction,
  we characterize the potential energy surfaces of representative model systems with
  accurate coupled cluster theory calculations. To reveal the relationship of these
  energetics to the balance of these interactions in proteins, we curate a set of
  4000 HBs, of which textgreater500 are ambifunctional HBs, in high-resolution protein
  structures. We show that our model systems accurately predict the favored HB structural
  properties. Differences are apparent in HBA/HBD preference for aromatic Tyr versus
  aliphatic Ser/Thr hydroxyls because Tyr forms significantly stronger O–H⋯O HBs than
  N–H⋯O HBs in contrast to comparable strengths of the two for Ser/Thr. Despite this
  residue-specific distinction, all models of residue pairs indicate an energetic
  benefit for simultaneous HBA and HBD interactions in an ambifunctional HB. Although
  the stabilization is less than the additive maximum due both to geometric constraints
  and many-body electronic effects, a wide range of ambifunctional HB geometries are
  more favorable than any single HB interaction.
