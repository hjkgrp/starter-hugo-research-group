abstract: Piecewise linearity of the energy with respect to fractional electron removal
  or addition is a requirement of an electronic structure method that necessitates
  the presence of a derivative discontinuity at integer electron occupation. Semi-local
  exchange-correlation (xc) approximations within density functional theory (DFT)
  fail to reproduce this behavior, giving rise to deviations from linearity with a
  convex global curvature that is evidence of many-electron, self-interaction error
  and electron delocalization. Popular functional tuning strategies focus on reproducing
  piecewise linearity, especially to improve predictions of optical properties. In
  a divergent approach, Hubbard U-augmented DFT (i.e., DFT+U) treats self-interaction
  errors by reducing the local curvature of the energy with respect to electron removal
  or addition from one localized subshell to the surrounding system. Although it has
  been suggested that DFT+U should simultaneously alleviate global and local curvature
  in the atomic limit, no detailed study on real systems has been carried out to probe
  the validity of this statement. In this work, we show when DFT+U should minimize
  deviations from linearity and demonstrate that a “+U” correction will never worsen
  the deviation from linearity of the underlying xc approximation. However, we explain
  varying degrees of efficiency of the approach over 27 octahedral transition metal
  complexes with respect to transition metal (Sc–Cu) and ligand strength (CO, NH3,
  and H2O) and investigate select pathological cases where the delocalization error
  is invisible to DFT+U within an atomic projection framework. Finally, we demonstrate
  that the global and local curvatures represent different quantities that show opposing
  behavior with increasing ligand field strength, and we identify where these two
  may still coincide.
