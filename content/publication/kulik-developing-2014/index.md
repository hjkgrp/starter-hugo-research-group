abstract: An approach to catalyst design is presented in which local potential energy
  surface models are first built to elucidate design principles and then used to identify
  larger scaffold motifs that match the target geometries. Carbon sequestration via
  hydration is used as the model reaction, and three- and four-coordinate sp2 or sp3
  nitrogen-ligand motifs are considered for ZnII metals. The comparison of binding,
  activation and product release energies over a large range of interaction distances
  and angles suggests that four-coordinate short ZnII—Nsp3 bond distances favor a
  rapid turnover for CO2 hydration. This design strategy is then confirmed by computationally
  characterizing the reactivity of a known mimic over a range of metal–nitrogen bond
  lengths. A search of existing catalysts in a chemical database reveals structures
  that match the target geometry from model calculations, and subsequent calculations
  have identified these structures as potentially effective for CO2 hydration and
  sequestration.
