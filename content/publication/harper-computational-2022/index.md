abstract: While computational screening with first-principles density functional theory
  (DFT) is essential for evaluating candidate catalysts, limitations in accuracy typically
  prevent the prediction of experimentally relevant activities. Exemplary of these
  challenges are homogeneous water oxidation catalysts (WOCs) where differences in
  experimental conditions or small changes in ligand structure can alter rate constants
  by over an order of magnitude. Here, we compute mechanistically relevant electronic
  and energetic properties for 19 mononuclear Ru transition-metal complexes (TMCs)
  from three experimental water oxidation catalysis studies. We discover that 15 of
  these TMCs have experimental activities that correlate with a single property, the
  ionization potential of the Ru(II)â€“O2 catalytic intermediate. This scaling parameter
  allows the quantitative understanding of activity trends and provides insight into
  the rate-limiting behavior. We use this approach to rationalize differences in activity
  with different experimental conditions, and we qualitatively analyze the source
  of distinct behavior for different electronic states in the other four catalysts.
  Comparison to closely related single-atom catalysts and modified WOCs enables rationalization
  of the source of rate enhancement in these WOCs.
