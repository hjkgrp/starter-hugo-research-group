abstract: Hybrid quantum mechanical–molecular mechanical (QM/MM) simulations are widely
  used in studies of enzymatic catalysis. Until recently, it has been cost prohibitive
  to determine the asymptotic limit of key energetic and structural properties with
  respect to increasingly large QM regions. Leveraging recent advances in electronic
  structure efficiency and accuracy, we investigate catalytic properties in catechol
  O-methyltransferase, a prototypical methyltransferase critical to human health.
  Using QM regions ranging in size from reactants-only (64 atoms) to nearly one-third
  of the entire protein (940 atoms), we show that properties such as the activation
  energy approach within chemical accuracy of the large-QM asymptotic limits rather
  slowly, requiring approximately 500–600 atoms if the QM residues are chosen simply
  by distance from the substrate. This slow approach to asymptotic limit is due to
  charge transfer from protein residues to the reacting substrates. Our large QM/MM
  calculations enable identification of charge separation for fragments in the transition
  state as a key component of enzymatic methyl transfer rate enhancement. We introduce
  charge shift analysis that reveals the minimum number of protein residues (approximately
  11–16 residues or 200–300 atoms for COMT) needed for quantitative agreement with
  large-QM simulations. The identified residues are not those that would be typically
  selected using criteria such as chemical intuition or proximity. These results provide
  a recipe for a more careful determination of QM region sizes in future QM/MM studies
  of enzymes.
