abstract: Silver phenylselenolate (AgSePh, also known as ``mithrene'') and silver
  phenyltellurolate (AgTePh, also known as ``tethrene'') are two-dimensional (2D)
  van der Waals semiconductors belonging to an emerging class of hybrid organic– inorganic
  materials called metal– organic chalcogenolates. Despite having the same crystal
  structure, AgSePh and AgTePh exhibit a strikingly different excitonic behavior.
  Whereas AgSePh exhibits narrow, fast luminescence with a minimal Stokes shift, AgTePh
  exhibits comparatively slow luminescence that is significantly broadened and red-shifted
  from its absorption minimum. Using time-resolved and temperature-dependent absorption
  and emission microspectroscopy, combined with subgap photoexcitation studies, we
  show that exciton dynamics in AgTePh films are dominated by an intrinsic self-trapping
  behavior, whereas dynamics in AgSePh films are dominated by the interaction of band-edge
  excitons with a finite number of extrinsic defect/trap states. Density functional
  theory calculations reveal that AgSePh has simple parabolic band edges with a direct
  gap at $Γ$, whereas AgTePh has a saddle point at $Γ$ with a horizontal splitting
  along the $Γ$-N1 direction. The correlation between the unique band structure of
  AgTePh and exciton self-trapping behavior is unclear, prompting further exploration
  of excitonic phenomena in this emerging class of hybrid 2D semiconductors.
