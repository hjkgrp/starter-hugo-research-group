abstract: Millions of distinct metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) can be made by combining
  metal nodes and organic linkers. At present, over 90,000 MOFs have been synthesized
  and over 500,000 predicted. This raises the question whether a new experimental
  or predicted structure adds new information. For MOFÂ chemists, the chemical design
  space is a combination of pore geometry, metal nodes, organic linkers, and functional
  groups, but at present we do not have a formalism to quantify optimal coverage of
  chemical design space. In this work, we develop a machine learning method to quantify
  similarities of MOFs to analyse their chemical diversity. This diversity analysis
  identifies biases in the databases, and we show that such bias can lead to incorrect
  conclusions. The developed formalism in this study provides a simple and practical
  guideline to see whether new structures will have the potential for new insights,
  or constitute a relatively small variation of existing structures.
