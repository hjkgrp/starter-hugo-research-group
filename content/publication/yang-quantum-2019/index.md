abstract: Methyl transferases (MTases) are a well-studied class of enzymes for which
  competing enzymatic enhancement mechanisms have been suggested, ranging from structural
  methyl group CH···X hydrogen bonds (HBs) to electrostatic- and charge-transfer-driven
  stabilization of the transition state (TS). We identified all Class I MTases for
  which reasonable resolution (textless2.0 Å) crystal structures could be used to
  form catalytically competent ternary complexes for multiscale (i.e., quantum-mechanical/molecular-mechanical
  or QM/MM) simulation of the SN2 methyl transfer reaction coordinate. The four Class
  I MTases studied have both distinct functions (e.g., protein repair or biosynthesis)
  and substrate nucleophiles (i.e., C, N, or O). While CH···X HBs stabilize all reactant
  complexes, no universal TS stabilization role is found for these interactions in
  MTases. A consistent picture is instead obtained through analysis of charge transfer
  and electrostatics, wherein much of cofactor–substrate charge separation is maintained
  in the TS region, and electrostatic potential is correlated with substrate nucleophilicity
  (i.e., intrinsic reactivity).
