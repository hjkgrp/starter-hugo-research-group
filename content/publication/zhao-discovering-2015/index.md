abstract: We employ high-temperature ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) as a sampling
  approach to discover low-energy, semiconducting, indium phosphide nanostructures.
  Starting from undercoordinated models of InP (e.g., a single layer of InP(111)),
  rapid rearrangement into a stabilized, higher-coordinate but amorphous cluster is
  observed across the size range considered (In3P3 to In22P22). These clusters exhibit
  exponential decrease in energy per atom with system size as effective coordination
  increases, which we define through distance-cutoff coordination number assignment
  and partial charge analysis. The sampling approach is robust to initial configuration
  choice, as consistent results are obtained when alternative crystal models or computationally
  efficient generation of structures from sequential addition and removal of atoms
  are employed. This consistency is observed across the 66 structures compared here,
  and even when as many as five approaches are compared, the average difference in
  energy per pair of atoms in these structures is only 1.5 kcal/mol at a given system
  size. Interestingly, the energies of these amorphous clusters are lower than geometry
  optimized spherical models of bulk InP typically used for simulations of quantum
  dots. Favorable energetics appear correlated to highly coordinated indium and phosphorus
  with coordination numbers up to 5 and 7, respectively, as well as formation of phosphorusâ€“phosphorus
  bonds.
