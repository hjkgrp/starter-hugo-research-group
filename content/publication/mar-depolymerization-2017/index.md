abstract: Lignocellulosic biomass is an abundant, rich source of aromatic compounds,
  but direct utilization of raw lignin has been hampered by both the high heterogeneity
  and variability of linking bonds in this biopolymer. Ab initio steered molecular
  dynamics (AISMD) has emerged both as a fruitful direct computational screening approach
  to identify products that occur through mechanical depolymerization (i.e., in sonication
  or ball-milling) and as a sampling approach. By varying the direction of force and
  sampling over 750 AISMD trajectories, we identify numerous possible pathways through
  which lignin depolymerization may occur in pyrolysis or through catalytic depolymerization
  as well. Here, we present eight unique major depolymerization pathways discovered
  via AISMD for the recently characterized spirodienone lignin branching linkage that
  may comprise around 10% weight of all lignin in some softwoods. We extract representative
  trajectories from AISMD and carry out reaction pathway analysis to identify energetically
  favorable pathways for lignin depolymerization. Importantly, we identify dynamical
  effects that could not be observed through more traditional calculations of bond
  dissociation energies. Such effects include thermodynamically favorable recovery
  of aromaticity in the dienone ring that leads to near-barrierless subsequent ether
  cleavage and hydrogen-bonding effects that stabilize newly formed radicals. Some
  of the most stable spirodienone fragments that reside at most 1 eV above the reactant
  structure are formed with only 2 eV barriers for Câ€“C bond cleavage, suggesting key
  targets for catalyst design to drive targeted depolymerization of lignin.
