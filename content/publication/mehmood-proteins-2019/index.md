abstract: Biosynthetic enzyme complexes selectively catalyze challenging chemical
  transformations, including alkane functionalization (e.g., halogenation of threonine,
  Thr, by the non-heme iron halogenase SyrB2). However, the role of complex formation
  in enabling reactivity and guiding selectivity is poorly understood, owing to the
  challenges associated with obtaining detailed structural information on the dynamically
  associating protein complexes. Combining over 10 μs of classical molecular dynamics
  of SyrB2 and the acyl carrier protein SyrB1 with large-scale QM/MM simulation, we
  investigate the substrate–protein and protein–protein dynamics that give rise to
  experimentally observed substrate positioning and reactivity trends. We confirm
  the presence of a hypothesized substrate-delivery channel in SyrB2 through free
  energy simulations that show channel opening with a low free energy barrier. We
  identify stabilizing interactions at the SyrB2/SyrB1 interface that are compatible
  with phosphopantetheine (PPant) delivery of substrate to SyrB2. By sampling metal–substrate
  distances observed in experimental spectroscopy of native SyrB2/SyrB1-PPant-S-Thr
  and non-native substrates, we characterize essential protein–substrate interactions
  that are responsible for substrate positioning, and thus, reactivity. We observe
  the hydroxyl side chain and terminal amine of the native Thr substrate to form cooperative
  hydrogen bonds with a single N123 residue in SyrB2. In comparison, non-native substrates
  that lack the hydroxyl interact more flexibly with the protein and therefore can
  orient closer to the Fe center, explaining their preferential hydroxylation.
