abstract: An understanding of protein stability requires capturing dynamic rearrangements
  and coupled properties over long lengthscales. Nevertheless, the extent of coupling
  in these systems has typically only been studied for classical degrees of freedom.
  To understand the potential benefit of extending such analysis to the coupling of
  electronic structure properties, we have carried out extensive semi-empirical quantum
  mechanical molecular dynamics of two Trp-cage variants. Small differences in the
  sequence of the two peptides lead to differences in their thermal stability that
  are revealed through electronic structure coupling analysis. In comparison, we find
  limited evidence that geometric coupling can distinguish the behavior of the two
  peptides. We show that Asp1 in the more stable variant shows significantly enhanced
  coupling to both sequence-adjacent and more sequence-distant residues. Non-nearest-neighbor
  couplings are stronger in the more stable variant, indicating a network of residues
  that help stabilize the protein. Our study highlights the complementary benefit
  of charge coupling analysis to interpret protein structure-function relationships.
