    abstract = { Polymer networks are complex materials with a broad distribution of molecular states, making it challenging to establish direct connections between the structure of individual network components and macroscopic material behavior. Recent advancements in mechanochemistry, dynamic covalent chemistry, and single-molecule characterization, however, are transforming this perspective. By leveraging the chemical reactivity of network junctions and integrating mechanophores into polymer networks, direct, quantitative links between molecular behavior and material properties are now being established. These insights are challenging long-standing property trade-offs and creating avenues for polymers with enhanced mechanical properties. This Perspective highlights how new molecule-to-material relationships in polymer networks are simultaneously advancing the field of polymer chemistry and uncovering fundamental principles that extend beyond polymer systems, enriching our broader understanding of reactivity, structure, and bonding in complex materials. }
