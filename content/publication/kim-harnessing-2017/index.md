abstract: Indium phosphide quantum dots (QDs) represent promising replacements for
  more toxic QDs, but InP QD production lags behind other QD materials due to limited
  understanding of how to tune InP QD growth. We carry out a first-principles, computational
  screen of the tuning of In carboxylate precursor chemistry to alter the kinetics
  of elementary steps in InP QD growth. We employ a large database normally used for
  discovery of therapeutic drug-like molecules to discover design rules for these
  inorganic complexes while maintaining realism (i.e., stable, synthetically accessible
  substituents) and providing diversity in a 210-molecule test set. We show the In–O
  bond cleavage energy, which is tuned through ligand functionalization, to be a useful
  proxy for In–P bond formation energetics in InP QD synthesis. Energy decomposition
  analysis on a 32-molecule subset reveals that lower activation energies correlate
  to later transition states, due to stabilization from greater In–P bond formation
  and more favorable reaction energetics. Our simulations suggest that altering ligand
  nucleophilicity tunes the reaction barrier over a 10 kcal/mol range, providing the
  conjugate acid’s pKa as an experimental handle to lead to better control of growth
  conditions and to improve synthesized InP QD quality. Importantly, these trends
  hold regardless of phosphorus precursor chemistries and in the longer chain length
  ligands typically used in synthesis.
