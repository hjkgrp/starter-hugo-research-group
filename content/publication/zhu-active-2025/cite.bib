    abstract = { Heterogeneous olefin metathesis catalysts exhibit low active site densities and unpredictable kinetics due to dynamic active site formation and decay processes. Here, we establish a quantitative framework that captures active site generation, renewal, and decay in olefin metathesis over silica-supported molybdenum oxide catalysts, enabling a mechanistic explanation of catalytic behavior and strategies to achieve high, stable activity. Steady-state active site titrations reveal that 2,3-dimethyl-butene isomers (4MEs) cofeeding increases active site density by up to 4.3-fold, directly correlating with enhanced metathesis rates. Spectroscopic studies demonstrate that 4MEs facilitate Mo(VI) reduction to Mo(IV) and interact strongly with surface Si–OH groups, generating labile protons that promote active site formation via a 1,2-proton shift mechanism. Kinetic modeling indicates that ethylene acts as a decay promoter, shifting kinetic control away from the Chauvin cycle and suppressing metathesis activity. Comparative studies on catalysts with varying Mo loading reveal that promotion is most effective for dispersed molybdate species, with a decline at higher Mo loadings. These findings provide a unified mechanistic framework for heterogeneous olefin metathesis, offering new strategies to enhance active site accessibility, mitigate deactivation, and optimize catalyst design. }
