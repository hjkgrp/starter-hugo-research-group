abstract: ' Vanadyl intermediates are frequently used as mimics for the fleeting Fe(IV)═O
  intermediate in non-heme iron enzymes that catalyze C–H activation. Using density
  functional theory and correlated wavefunction theory, we investigate the degree
  to which the electronic structure of vanadium mimics is comparable to that of catalytic
  iron intermediates. Our calculations reveal crucial structural and energetic differences
  between vanadyl and ferryl intermediates primarily due to the former having a low-spin
  ground state and the latter having a high-spin one. This difference in spin state
  leads to differences in energetics for accessing isomers that confer activity in
  non-heme hydroxylase and halogenase enzymes. While interconversion between monodentate
  and bidentate succinate isomers of the key metal-oxo/hydroxo intermediates is energetically
  favorable for Fe, it is strongly unfavorable in V mimics. Additionally, isomerization
  of a terminal metal-oxo between an axial and equatorial position is energetically
  unfavorable for Fe but favorable for V. Analyses of binding strengths of Fe and
  V intermediates to α-ketoglutarate and succinate co-substrates reveal that both
  co-substrates bind more strongly to V than to Fe. Given the increasingly frequent
  use by the biochemistry community of V-based intermediates as mimics, our work highlights
  the limitations of this approach in studies of non-heme iron enzymes.'
