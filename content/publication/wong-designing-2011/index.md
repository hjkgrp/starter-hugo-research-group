abstract: 'One method for CO2 capture is to dissolve CO2 in water to form carbonic
  acid. This reaction (CO2+H20→H2CO3(aq)) is remarkably slow but is catalyzed in biological
  systems by an enzyme called carbonic anhydrase (CA). The catalyzed reaction is diffusion
  limited and occurs at near neutral pH. The enzyme catalytic center is composed of
  a Zn(II) ion that is coordinated by 3 histidine residues and an axial water/hydroxyl
  group. A nucleophilic attack by the hydroxyl group on the CO2 molecule is the first
  step in the reaction mechanism. Cu(II), Hg(II), Cd(II), Ni(II), Co(II) and Mn(II)
  can bind the CA binding site and substitute the zinc ion; however, only Co(II) yields
  rates comparable to Zn(II). Unfortunately, an enzyme, such as carbonic anhydrase,
  is not amenable for industrial applications where a wide range of physico-chemical
  conditions exist. Enzymes are vulnerable to large pressures, high temperature, and
  high ionic strength. Efforts to isolate the key structural features responsible
  for catalysis led to the development of small-molecule mimetics of the CA catalytic
  site. These mimetics can, in turn, be used as catalyst for CO2 sequestration. Two
  of the fastest catalyst are the cyclic molecules: 1, 4, 7, 10-tetraazacyclododedacane
  and 1, 5, 9-triazacyclododedacane (both complexed with a Zn(II) ion). Nitrogen atoms
  in these cyclic molecules mimic the imidazole nitrogens of the CA active site. It
  is possible to examine the energetics of these compounds using transition state
  theory for the purposes of designing more efficient catalysts. Transition state
  theory predicts that the reaction rate constant is proportional to exp(−Ea/kT),
  where Ea denotes the activation energy, k the Boltzmann constant, and T the temperature
  of the reaction. The activation energy is the energetic cost of forming the reaction
  transition state from the reactants. Ab initio calculations can yield the activation
  energy, which can, in principle, be used as a design metric for more efficient catalysts.
  Using this approach, the difference in kinetic rate constant between the tetra-
  and tri-aza dodecane catalysts can be determined. Furthermore, the rates of the
  corresponding Co(II) catalysts were explored. Our data suggests this is a viable
  method for the design of inorganic small-molecule catalysts.'
