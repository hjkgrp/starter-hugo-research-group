abstract: Transition-metal centers are the active sites for a broad variety of biological
  and inorganic chemical reactions. Notwithstanding this central importance, density-functional
  theory calculations based on generalized-gradient approximations often fail to describe
  energetics, multiplet structures, reaction barriers, and geometries around the active
  sites. We suggest here an alternative approach, derived from the Hubbard U correction
  to solid-state problems, that provides an excellent agreement with correlated-electron
  quantum chemistry calculations in test cases that range from the ground state of
  Fe2 and Feâˆ’2 to the addition elimination of molecular hydrogen on FeO+. The Hubbard
  U is determined with a novel self-consistent procedure based on a linear-response
  approach.
