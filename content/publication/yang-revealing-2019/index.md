abstract: 'Enzymes have evolved to facilitate challenging reactions at ambient conditions
  with specificity seldom matched by other catalysts. Computational modeling provides
  valuable insight into catalytic mechanism, and the large size of enzymes mandates
  multi-scale, quantum mechanical-molecular mechanical (QM/MM) simulations. Although
  QM/MM plays an essential role in balancing simulation cost to enable sampling with
  the full QM treatment needed to understand electronic structure in enzyme active
  sites, the relative importance of these two strategies for understanding enzyme
  mechanism is not well known. We explore challenges in QM/MM for studying the reactivity
  and stability of three diverse enzymes: i) Mg2+-dependent catechol O-methyltransferase
  (COMT), ii) radical enzyme choline trimethylamine lyase (CutC), and iii) DNA methyltransferase
  (DNMT1), which has structural Zn2+ binding sites. In COMT, strong non-covalent interactions
  lead to long range coupling of electronic structure properties across the active
  site, but the more isolated nature of the metallocofactor in DNMT1 leads to faster
  convergence of some properties. We quantify these effects in COMT by computing covariance
  matrices of by-residue electronic structure properties during dynamics and along
  the reaction coordinate. In CutC, we observe spontaneous bond cleavage following
  initiation events, highlighting the importance of sampling and dynamics. We use
  electronic structure analysis to quantify the relative importance of CHO and OHO
  non-covalent interactions in imparting reactivity. These three diverse cases enable
  us to provide some general recommendations regarding QM/MM simulation of enzymes.'
