abstract: 'The challenge of activating inert C–H bonds motivates a study of catalysts
  that draws from what can be accomplished by natural enzymes and translates these
  advantageous features into transition-metal complex (TMC) and material mimics. Inert
  C–H bond activation reactivity has been observed in a diverse number of predominantly
  iron-containing enzymes from the heme-P450s to non-heme iron α-ketoglutarate-dependent
  enzymes and methane monooxygenases. Computational studies have played a key role
  in correlating active site variables such as the primary coordination sphere, oxidation
  state, and spin state to reactivity. TMCs, zeolites, metal organic frameworks (MOFs),
  and single-atom catalysts (SACs) are synthetic inorganic materials that have been
  designed to incorporate Fe active sites in analogy to single sites in enzymes. In
  these systems, computational studies have been essential in supporting spectroscopic
  assignments and quantifying the effects of the metal-local environment on C–H bond
  reactivity. High-throughput virtual screening tools that have been widely used for
  bulk metal catalysis do not readily extend to the single-site inorganic catalysts
  where metal–ligand bonding and localized d-electrons govern reaction energetics.
  These localized d-electrons can also necessitate wavefunction theory calculations
  when density functional theory (DFT) is not sufficiently accurate. Where sufficient
  computational or experimental data can be gathered, machine learning has helped
  uncover more general design rules for reactivity or stability. As we continue to
  investigate metalloprotein active sites, we gain insights that enable us to design
  stable, active, and selective single-site catalysts. '
