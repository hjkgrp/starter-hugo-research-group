abstract: 'The immobilization of homogeneous catalysts onto supports to improve recyclability
  while maintaining catalytic efficiency is often a trial-and-error process limited
  by poor control of the local catalyst environment and few strategies to append catalysts
  to support materials. Here, we introduce a modular heterogenous catalysis platform
  that addresses these challenges. Our approach leverages the well-defined interiors
  of self-assembled Pd12L24 metal–organic cages/polyhedra (MOCs): simple mixing of
  a catalyst-ligand of choice with a polymeric ligand, spacer ligands, and a Pd salt
  induces self-assembly of Pd12L24-cross-linked polymer gels featuring endohedrally
  catalyst-functionalized junctions. Semi-empirical calculations show that catalyst
  incorporation into the MOC junctions of these materials has minimal affect on the
  MOC geometry, giving rise to well-defined nanoconfined catalyst domains as confirmed
  experimentally using several techniques. Given the unique network topology of these
  freestanding gels, they are mechanically robust regardless of their endohedral catalyst
  composition, allowing them to be physically manipulated and transferred from one
  reaction to another to achieve multiple rounds of catalysis. Moreover, by decoupling
  the catalyst environment (interior of MOC junctions) from the physical properties
  of the support (the polymer matrix), this strategy enables catalysis in environments
  where homogeneous catalyst analogues are not viable, as demonstrated for the Au(I)-catalyzed
  cyclization of 4-pentynoic acid in aqueous media.'
