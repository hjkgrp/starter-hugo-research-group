abstract: Recent advances in machine learning or artificial intelligence for vision
  and natural language processing that have enabled the development of new technologies
  such as personal assistants or self-driving cars have brought machine learning and
  artificial intelligence to the forefront of popular culture. The accumulation of
  these algorithmic advances along with the increasing availability of large data
  sets and readily available high performance computing has played an important role
  in bringing machine learning applications to such a wide range of disciplines. Given
  the emphasis in the chemical sciences on the relationship between structure and
  function, whether in biochemistry or in materials chemistry, adoption of machine
  learning by chemists. Machine Learning in Chemistry focuses on the following to
  launch your understanding of this highly relevant topic:Topics most relevant to
  chemical sciences are the focus.Focus on concepts rather than technical details.
  Comprehensive referencing provides sources to go to for more technical details.Key
  details about methods that underlie machine learning (not easy, but important to
  understand the strengths as well as the limitations of these methods and to identify
  where domain knowledge can be most readily applied.Familiarity with basic single
  variable calculus and in linear algebra will be helpful although we have provided
  step-by-step derivations where they are important
