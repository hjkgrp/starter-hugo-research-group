abstract: Approximate, semilocal density functional theory (DFT) suffers from delocalization
  error that can lead to a paradoxical model of catalytic surfaces that both overbind
  adsorbates yet are also too stable. We investigate the effect of two widely applied
  approaches for delocalization error correction, (i) affordable DFT+U (i.e., semilocal
  DFT augmented with a Hubbard U) and (ii) hybrid functionals with an admixture of
  Hartreeâ€“Fock (HF) exchange, on surface and adsorbate energies across a range of
  rutile transition metal oxides widely studied for their promise as water-splitting
  catalysts. We observe strongly row- and period-dependent trends with DFT+U, which
  increases surface formation energies only in early transition metals (e.g., Ti and
  V) and decreases adsorbate energies only in later transition metals (e.g., Ir and
  Pt). Both global and local hybrids destabilize surfaces and reduce adsorbate binding
  across the periodic table, in agreement with higher-level reference calculations.
  Density analysis reveals why hybrid functionals correct both quantities, whereas
  DFT+U does not. We recommend local, range-separated hybrids for the accurate modeling
  of catalysis in transition metal oxides at only a modest increase in computational
  cost over semilocal DFT.
