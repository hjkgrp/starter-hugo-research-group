abstract: 'The pressing demand for critical metals necessitates the development of advanced ion separation technologies for circular resource economies. To separate transition metal ions, which exhibit near-identical chemical properties, adsorbents and membranes must be designed with ultraselective chemistries. We leverage the customizability of metalâ€“organic frameworks (MOFs) to systematically study the role of material chemistry in sorption and selectivity of Co2+, Ni2+, and Cu2+. To isolate the effect of MOF linker chemistry, a series of functionalized UiO-66 derivatives was synthesized from the same parent MOF through solvent-assisted linker exchange, which produced >70% linker conversion for nine linker functional groups. This work presents the first instance of post-synthetic incorporation of carboxylic acid groups in UiO-66, which was achieved with >90% conversion. A technique was developed for in situ MOF deposition in a quartz crystal microbalance to precisely monitor real-time sorption of Co2+, Ni2+, and Cu2+ in UiO-66-X [where X = H, (OH)2, COOH, or (COOH)2] and validated by comparing to batch sorption experiments (5 mM, pH 5). Carboxylic acid-functionalized derivatives exhibited the highest uptake and a trend of Cu2+ > Co2+ > Ni2+, with the highest sorption of 5.5% (g Cu2+/g MOF), equivalent to 37% mol Cu2+/mol linker, occurring in UiO-66-(COOH)2. Binary salt and single salt batch sorption experiments demonstrated preferential copper binding in all studied MOFs and selectivity enhancement in binary salt conditions. UiO-66-(COOH)2 exhibited the highest selectivity of 14 for equimolar Cu2+/Ni2+ and 13 for Cu2+/Co2+. Density functional theory calculations of ion binding energy at UiO-66-X pore windows indicate higher copper affinity for all functional groups and a trend in binding energy of UiO-66-(COOH)2 > UiO-66-COOH > UiO-66-(OH)2 > UiO-66-H for each transition metal ion, in good agreement with experimental results. This work highlights the effectiveness of post-synthetic modification for tuning nanostructured materials to achieve similar ion separations.'
