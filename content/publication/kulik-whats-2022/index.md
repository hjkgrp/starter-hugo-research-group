abstract: Machine learning (ML) has become a central focus of the computational chemistry
  community. I will first discuss my personal history in the field. Then I will provide
  a broader view of how this resurgence in ML interest echoes and advances upon earlier
  efforts. Although numerous changes have brought about this latest wave, one of the
  most significant is the increased accuracy and efficiency of low-cost methods (e.
  g., density functional theory or DFT) that have made it possible to generate large
  data sets for ML models. ML has also been used to bypass, guide, or improve DFT.
  The field of computational chemistry thus finds itself at a crossroads as ML both
  augments and supersedes traditional efforts. I will present what I believe the role
  of the computational chemist will be in this evolving landscape, with specific focus
  on my experience in the development of autonomous workflows in computational materials
  discovery for open-shell transition-metal chemistry.
