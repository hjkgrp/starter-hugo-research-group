abstract: Despite its widespread use in chemical discovery, approximate density functional
  theory (DFT) is poorly suited to many targets, such as those containing open-shell,
  3d transition metals that can be expected to have strong multireference (MR) character.
  For discovery workflows to be predictive, we need automated, low-cost methods that
  can distinguish the regions of chemical space where DFT should be applied from those
  where it should not. We curate more than 4800 open-shell transition-metal complexes
  up to hundreds of atoms in size from prior high-throughput DFT studies and evaluate
  affordable, finite-temperature DFT fractional occupation number (FON)-based MR diagnostics.
  We show that intuitive measures of strong correlation (i.e., the HOMO–LUMO gap)
  are not predictive of MR character as judged by FON-based diagnostics. Analysis
  of independently trained machine learning (ML) models to predict HOMO–LUMO gaps
  and FON-based diagnostics reveals differences in the metal and ligand sensitivity
  of the two quantities. We use our trained ML models to rapidly evaluate MR character
  over a space of ∼187000 theoretical complexes, identifying large-scale trends in
  spin-state-dependent MR character and finding small HOMO–LUMO gap complexes while
  ensuring low MR character.
