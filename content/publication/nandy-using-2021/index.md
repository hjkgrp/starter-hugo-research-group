abstract: 'Although the tailored metal active sites and porous architectures of MOFs
  hold great promise for engineering challenges ranging from gas separations to catalysis,
  a lack of understanding of how to improve their stability limits their use in practice.
  To overcome this limitation, we extract thousands of published reports of the key
  aspects of MOF stability necessary for their practical application: the ability
  to withstand high temperatures without degrading and the capacity to be activated
  by removal of solvent molecules. From nearly 4000 manuscripts, we use natural language
  processing and image analysis to obtain over 2000 solvent-removal stability measures
  and 3000 thermal degradation temperatures. We analyze the relationships between
  stability properties and the chemical and geometric structures in this set to identify
  limits of prior heuristics derived from smaller sets of MOFs. By training predictive
  machine learning (ML, i.e., Gaussian process and artificial neural network) models
  to encode the structureâ€“property relationships with graph- and pore-structure-based
  representations, we are able to make predictions of stability orders of magnitude
  faster than conventional physics-based modeling or experiment. Interpretation of
  important features in ML models provides insights that we use to identify strategies
  to engineer increased stability into typically unstable 3d-transition-metal-containing
  MOFs that are frequently targeted for catalytic applications. We expect our approach
  to accelerate the time to discovery of stable, practical MOF materials for a wide
  range of applications.'
