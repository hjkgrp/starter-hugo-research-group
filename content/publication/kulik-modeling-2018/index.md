abstract: This chapter first defines fundamental concepts governing chemical transformation
  on a potential energy surface (PES). Then, it introduces theoretical and computational
  methodology that incorporates the effect of mechanical force in order to determine
  its effect on chemical transformation rates and pathways. This theoretical and computational
  background is followed by a discussion of the basics of mechanochemical experiments,
  including both approaches and the nature of molecules studied. This background then
  enables the readers to review some fundamental, representative cases of how computation
  has provided insight into mechanochemical bond cleavage. The chapter further provides
  a summary of practical challenges for the novice wishing to carry out mechanochemical
  simulation. While relevant for all fields of simulation, a particularly pertinent
  concern in the first-principles modeling of mechanochemical bond cleavage is the
  balance of computational cost and accuracy. The chapter concludes with an overview
  of the current status of computational mechanochemistry and related approaches.
