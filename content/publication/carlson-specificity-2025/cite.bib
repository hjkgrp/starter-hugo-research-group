abstract = {Accumulating evidence has connected the chemically unstable, DNA-damaging gut bacterial natural product colibactin to colorectal cancer, including the identification of mutational signatures that are thought to arise from colibactin-DNA interstrand cross-links (ICLs). However, we currently lack direct information regarding the structure of this lesion. In this work, we combined mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to elucidate the specificity and structure of the colibactin-DNA ICL. We found that colibactin alkylates within the minor groove of adenine- and thymine-rich DNA, explaining the origins of mutational signatures. Unexpectedly, we discovered that the chemically unstable central motif of colibactin mediates the sequence specificity of cross-linking. By directly elucidating colibactin’s interactions with DNA, this work enhances our understanding of the structure and genotoxic mechanisms of this cancer-linked gut bacterial natural product. The small molecule colibactin is produced by some strains of Escherichia coli and has been associated with DNA damage and colorectal cancer in vitro and in humans. The chemical structure of colibactin has been the subject of intense study, but it has remained somewhat unclear due to the instability of this molecule and the difficulty in producing large quantities of authentic product. By incubating a short oligonucleotide with E. coli producing colibactin, Carlson et al. were able to purify cross-linked DNA and investigate its structure using mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (see the Perspective by Schärer). The authors observed an α-ketoiminium group bound in the DNA minor grove and other contacts that help to explain the observed AT-rich DNA specificity, a signature that has been documented in some human colorectal cancer genomes. —Michael A.
