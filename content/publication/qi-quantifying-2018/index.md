abstract: Multi-scale quantum-mechanical/molecular-mechanical (QM/MM) and large-scale
  QM simulation provide valuable insight into enzyme mechanism and structure-property
  relationships. Analysis of the electron density afforded through these methods can
  enhance our understanding of how the enzyme environment modulates reactivity at
  the enzyme active site. From this perspective, tools from conceptual density functional
  theory to interrogate electron densities can provide added insight into enzyme function.
  We recently introduced the highly parallelizable Fukui shift analysis (FSA) method,
  which identifies how frontier states of an active site are altered by the presence
  of an additional QM residue to identify when QM treatment of a residue is essential
  as a result of quantum-mechanically affecting the behavior of the active site. We
  now demonstrate and analyze distance and residue dependence of Fukui function shifts
  in pairs of residues representing different non-covalent interactions. We also show
  how the interpretation of the Fukui function as a measure of relative nucleophilicity
  provides insight into enzymes that carry out SN2 methyl transfer. The FSA method
  represents a promising approach for the systematic, unbiased determination of quantum
  mechanical effects in enzymes and for other complex systems that necessitate multi-scale
  modeling.
