abstract: The conductor-like polarizable continuum model (C-PCM) with switching/Gaussian
  smooth discretization is a widely used implicit solvation model in quantum chemistry.
  We have previously implemented C-PCM solvation for Hartree-Fock (HF) and density
  functional theory (DFT) on graphical processing units (GPUs), enabling the quantum
  mechanical treatment of large solvated biomolecules. Here, we first propose a GPU-based
  algorithm for the PCM conjugate gradient linear solver that greatly improves the
  performance for very large molecules. The overhead for PCM-related evaluations now
  consumes less than 15% of the total runtime for DFT calculations on large molecules.
  Second, we demonstrate that our algorithms tailored for ground state C-PCM are transferable
  to excited state properties. Using a single GPU, our method evaluates the analytic
  gradient of the linear response PCM time-dependent density functional theory energy
  up to 80× faster than a conventional central processing unit (CPU)-based implementation.
  In addition, our C-PCM algorithms are transferable to other methods that require
  electrostatic potential (ESP) evaluations. For example, we achieve speed-ups of
  up to 130× for restricted ESP-based atomic charge evaluations, when compared to
  CPU-based codes. We also summarize and compare the different PCM cavity discretization
  schemes used in some popular quantum chemistry packages as a reference for both
  users and developers.
