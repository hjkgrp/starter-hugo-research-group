abstract: Machine learning (ML)-accelerated discovery requires large amounts of high-fidelity
  data to reveal predictive structure–property relationships. For many properties
  of interest in materials discovery, the challenging nature and high cost of data
  generation has resulted in a data landscape that is both scarcely populated and
  of dubious quality. Data-driven techniques starting to overcome these limitations
  include the use of consensus across functionals in density functional theory, the
  development of new functionals or accelerated electronic structure theories, and
  the detection of where computationally demanding methods are most necessary. When
  properties cannot be reliably simulated, large experimental data sets can be used
  to train ML models. In the absence of manual curation, increasingly sophisticated
  natural language processing and automated image analysis are making it possible
  to learn structure–property relationships from the literature. Models trained on
  these data sets will improve as they incorporate community feedback.
