abstract: 'As machine learning (ML) has matured, it has opened a new frontier in theoretical
  and computational chemistry by offering the promise of simultaneous paradigm shifts
  in accuracy and efficiency. Nowhere is this advance more needed, but also more challenging
  to achieve, than in the discovery of open-shell transition metal complexes. Here,
  localized d or f electrons exhibit variable bonding that is challenging to capture
  even with the most computationally demanding methods. Thus, despite great promise,
  clear obstacles remain in constructing ML models that can supplement or even replace
  explicit electronic structure calculations. In this article, I outline the recent
  advances in building ML models in transition metal chemistry, including the ability
  to approach sub-kcal/mol accuracy on a range of properties with tailored representations,
  to discover and enumerate complexes in large chemical spaces, and to reveal opportunities
  for design through analysis of feature importance. I discuss unique considerations
  that have been essential to enabling ML in open-shell transition metal chemistry,
  including (a) the relationship of data set size/diversity, model complexity, and
  representation choice, (b) the importance of quantitative assessments of both theory
  and model domain of applicability, and (c) the need to enable autonomous generation
  of reliable, large data sets both for ML model training and in active learning or
  discovery contexts. Finally, I summarize the next steps toward making ML a mainstream
  tool in the accelerated discovery of transition metal complexes. This article is
