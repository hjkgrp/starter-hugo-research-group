abstract: A delicate interplay of covalent and noncovalent interactions gives proteins
  their unique ability to flexibly play numerous roles in cellular processes. This
  interplay is inherently quantum mechanical and highly dynamic in nature. To directly
  interrogate the evolving nature of the electronic structure of proteins, we carry
  out 100-ps-scale ab initio molecular dynamics simulations of three representative
  small proteins with range-separated hybrid density functional theory. We quantify
  the nature and length-scale of the coupling of residue-specific charge probability
  distributions in these proteins. While some nonpolar residues exhibit expectedly
  narrow charge distributions, most polar and charged residues exhibit broad, multimodal
  distributions. Even for nonpolar residues, we observe sequence-specific deviations
  corresponding to charge accumulation or depletion that would be challenging to capture
  in a fixed charge force field. We quantify the effect of residue–residue interactions
  on charge distributions first with linear cross-correlations. We then show how additional
  insight can be gained from evaluating the mutual information of charge distributions.
  We show that a significant number of residues couple most strongly with residues
  that are distant in both sequence and space over a range of secondary structures
  including a-helical, b-sheet, disulfide bridging, and lasso motifs. The mutual information
  analysis is necessary to capture coupling between some polar and charged residues.
  These analyses are expected to be broadly useful in understanding the mechanisms
  of long-range charge transfer in proteins and for determining what interactions
  require a quantum mechanical description for predictive simulation of enzyme mechanism
  and protein function.
