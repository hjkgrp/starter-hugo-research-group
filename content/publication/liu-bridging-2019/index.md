abstract: Single atom catalysts (SACs) are emergent catalytic materials that have
  the promise of merging the scalability of heterogeneous catalysts with the high
  activity and atom economy of homogeneous catalysts. Computational, first-principles
  modeling can provide essential insight into SAC mechanism and active site configuration,
  where the sub-nm-scale environment can challenge even the highest-resolution experimental
  spectroscopic techniques. Nevertheless, the very properties that make SACs attractive
  in catalysis, such as localized d electrons of the isolated transition metal center,
  make them challenging to study with conventional computational modeling using density
  functional theory (DFT). For example, Fe/N-doped graphitic SACs have exhibited spin-state
  dependent reactivity that remains poorly understood. However, spin-state ordering
  in DFT is very sensitive to the nature of the functional approximation chosen. In
  this work, we develop accurate benchmarks from correlated wavefunction theory (WFT)
  for relevant octahedral complexes. We use those benchmarks to evaluate optimal DFT
  functional choice for predicting spin state ordering in small octahedral complexes
  as well as models of pyridinic and pyrrolic nitrogen environments expected in larger
  SACs. Using these guidelines, we determine Fe/N-doped graphene SAC model properties
  and reactivity as well as their sensitivities to DFT functional choice. Finally,
  we conclude with broad recommendations for computational modeling of open-shell
  transition metal single-atom catalysts.
