abstract: 'The scission of the O–O bond in O<sub>2</sub> and the formation of O–O bonds during
  the evolution of O<sub>2</sub> in photosynthesis are the engines of aerobic life as we know
  it. Likewise, the reduction of O2 and its reverse, the oxidation of reduced oxygen
  species to form O<sub>2</sub>, are indispensable components of emerging renewable technologies
  for energy storage and conversion. Storing and unleashing the energy contained within
  the O<sub>2</sub> molecule requires control over the formation or scission of the four-electron
  double bond between two oxygen atoms. Nature performs these demanding multi-electron
  transformations by distributing the redox burden among multiple metal ions: evolution
  created metalloenzymes with polynuclear clusters wherein metal ions act in concert
  to deliver or accept multiple electrons. Most relevant in this sense are the tetramanganese-calcium
  (Mn<sub>4</sub>CaO<sub>5</sub>) cluster in the oxygen-evolving complex of photosystem II, responsible
  for O<sub>2</sub> formation, and the tricopper clusters in multi-copper oxidases, which mediate
  O<sub>2</sub> reduction. The critical step in both O<sub>2</sub> reduction and O<sub>2</sub> evolution is the interconversion
  between multinuclear metal-oxo species, where the O atoms carry formal –2 charges,
  and O–O bonded species where the oxygen atoms are more oxidized. Attempts to mimic
  the natural systems with synthetic analogs have led to a number of elegant molecular
  clusters that shed light on the electron transfer events and stepwise mechanism
  of O–O bond cleavage and formation. To our knowledge, however, the interconversion
  between molecular O<sub>2</sub> and metal-oxo species in either synthetic or enzymatic discrete
  systems has not been documented. Here, we report that a tetramangenese cluster formed
  by self-assembly within a metal–organic framework (MOF) spontaneously cleaves the
  oxygen-oxygen double bond and reduces O<sub>2</sub> by four electrons at room temperature.
  The ensuing tetranuclear manganese-oxo cluster engages in weak C–H bond activation
  and, more importantly, is competent for O–O bond formation and O<sub>2</sub> evolution at elevated
  temperature, enabled by the head-to-head orientation of two fully reduced oxo atoms
  that bridge neighboring Mn pairs. This study demonstrates the viability of four-electron
  interconversion between molecular O<sub>2</sub> and metal-oxo species and highlights the importance
  of site-isolation for achieving multi-electron chemistry at polynuclear metal clusters.'
