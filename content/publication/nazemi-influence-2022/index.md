abstract: The Mo/W-containing metalloenzyme formate dehydrogenase (FDH) is an efficient
  and selective natural catalyst that reversibly converts CO2 to formate under ambient
  conditions. In this study, we investigate the impact of the greater protein environment
  on the electrostatic potential (ESP) of the active site. To model the enzyme environment,
  we used a combination of classical molecular dynamics and multiscale quantum-mechanical/molecular-mechanical
  (QM/MM) simulations. We leverage charge shift analysis to systematically construct
  QM regions and analyze the electronic environment of the active site by evaluating
  the degree of charge transfer between the core active site and the protein environment.
  The contribution of the terminal chalcogen ligand to the ESP of the metal center
  is substantial and dependent on the chalcogen identity, with similar, less negative
  ESPs for Se and S terminal chalcogens in comparison to O regardless of whether the
  metal is Mo or W. The orientation of the sidechains and conformations of the cofactor
  also affect the ESP, highlighting the importance of sampling dynamic fluctuations
  in the protein. Overall, our observations suggest that the terminal chalcogen ligand
  identity plays an important role in the enzymatic activity of FDH, suggesting opportunities
  for rational bioinspired catalyst design.
