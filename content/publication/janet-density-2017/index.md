abstract: 'First-principles simulation has played an ever-increasing role in the discovery
  and interpretation of the chemical properties of surface–adsorbate interactions.
  Nevertheless, key challenges remain for the computational chemist wishing to study
  surface chemistry: modelling the full extent of experimental conditions, managing
  computational cost, minimising human effort in simulation set-up and maximising
  accuracy. This article introduces new tools for streamlining surface chemistry simulation
  set-up and reviews some of the challenges in first-principles, density functional
  theory (DFT) simulation of surface phenomena. Furthermore, we provide a worked example
  of Co tetraphenylporphyrin on Au(1 1 1) in which we analyse electronic and energetic
  properties with semi-local DFT and compare to predictions made from hybrid functional
  and the so-called DFT+U correction. Through both review and the worked example,
  we aim to provide a pedagogical introduction to the challenges and the insight that
  first-principles simulation can provide in surface chemistry.'
