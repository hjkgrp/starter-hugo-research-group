abstract: The design of selective and active C–H activation catalysts for direct methane-to-methanol
  conversion is challenging. Bioinspired complexes that form high-valent metal–oxo
  intermediates capable of hydrogen abstraction and rebound hydroxylation are promising
  candidates. This promise has made them a target for computational high-throughput
  screening, typically simplified through the use of linear free energy relationships
  (LFERs). However, their mid-row transition-metal centers have numerous accessible
  spin and oxidation states that increase the combinatorial scale of design efforts.
  Here, we carry out a computational design screen of over 2500 mid-row 3d transition-metal
  complexes with four metals in numerous spin and oxidation states. We demonstrate
  the importance of spin/oxidation state in dictating design principles, limiting
  the generalization of strategies derived for widely studied high-spin Fe(II) catalysts
  to other metals or spin/oxidation states. Combined assessment of the effect of ligand-field
  tuning on reaction step energetics and on the identity of the ground state allows
  us to propose refined design strategies for spin-allowed methane-to-methanol catalysis.
  We observe weak coupling of energetics and design principles between reaction steps
  (e.g., oxo formation vs methanol release), meaning that LFERs do not generalize
  across our larger catalyst set. To rationalize relative reactivity in known catalysts,
  we instead compute independent reaction energies and propose strategies for further
  improvements in catalyst design.
