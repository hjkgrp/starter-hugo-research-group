abstract: 'The scission of the O–O bond in O2 and the formation of O–O bonds during
  the evolution of O2 in photosynthesis are the engines of aerobic life as we know
  it. Likewise, the reduction of O2 and its reverse, the oxidation of reduced oxygen
  species to form O2, are indispensable components of emerging renewable technologies
  for energy storage and conversion. Storing and unleashing the energy contained within
  the O2 molecule requires control over the formation or scission of the four-electron
  double bond between two oxygen atoms. Nature performs these demanding multi-electron
  transformations by distributing the redox burden among multiple metal ions: evolution
  created metalloenzymes with polynuclear clusters wherein metal ions act in concert
  to deliver or accept multiple electrons. Most relevant in this sense are the tetramanganese-calcium
  (Mn4CaO5) cluster in the oxygen-evolving complex of photosystem II, responsible
  for O2 formation, and the tricopper clusters in multi-copper oxidases, which mediate
  O2 reduction. The critical step in both O2 reduction and O2 evolution is the interconversion
  between multinuclear metal-oxo species, where the O atoms carry formal –2 charges,
  and O–O bonded species where the oxygen atoms are more oxidized. Attempts to mimic
  the natural systems with synthetic analogs have led to a number of elegant molecular
  clusters that shed light on the electron transfer events and stepwise mechanism
  of O–O bond cleavage and formation. To our knowledge, however, the interconversion
  between molecular O2 and metal-oxo species in either synthetic or enzymatic discrete
  systems has not been documented. Here, we report that a tetramangenese cluster formed
  by self-assembly within a metal–organic framework (MOF) spontaneously cleaves the
  oxygen-oxygen double bond and reduces O2 by four electrons at room temperature.
  The ensuing tetranuclear manganese-oxo cluster engages in weak C–H bond activation
  and, more importantly, is competent for O–O bond formation and O2 evolution at elevated
  temperature, enabled by the head-to-head orientation of two fully reduced oxo atoms
  that bridge neighboring Mn pairs. This study demonstrates the viability of four-electron
  interconversion between molecular O2 and metal-oxo species and highlights the importance
  of site-isolation for achieving multi-electron chemistry at polynuclear metal clusters.'
