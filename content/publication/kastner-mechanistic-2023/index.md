abstract: Non-heme iron halogenases and hydroxylases activate inert C-H bonds to selectively
  catalyze the functionalization of a diversity of biological products under physiological
  conditions. To better understand the differences in substrate positioning key to
  their divergent reactivities, we compiled available crystallographic and spectroscopic
  data, which revealed that hydroxylases prefer an acute oxo-Fe-H target angle, while
  halogenases prefer a more obtuse angle. With molecular dynamics simulations guided
  by this experimental information, we simulated the representative hydroxylases TauD
  and VioC and the halogenases BesD and WelO5 with both acute and obtuse harmonic
  restraints. We identified key native interactions that maintain the angle of approach
  in the respective enzymes, such as Asp94 in TauD and His127 in BesD. Moreover, our
  simulations reveal that the protein environment in halogenases prevents the sampling
  of acute angles observed in hydrogenases and vice versa. To validate these classical
  observations, we optimized the structure with large-scale quantum mechanical (QM)
  simulations and confirmed QM-derived substrate-enzyme hydrogen bond strengths were
  higher in the native configurations. To understand the effect of positioning on
  reactivity, we confirmed that reaction barriers for the rate-limiting hydrogen atom
  transfer reaction was slightly lower from an acute angle regardless of the enzyme-substrate
  complex. Analysis of the halogenase reaction coordinates reveals the formation of
  hydrogen bonding networks between the Fe(II)-hydroxyl, monodentate succinate, and
  a member of the second coordination sphere that may inhibit the hydroxyl rebound.
