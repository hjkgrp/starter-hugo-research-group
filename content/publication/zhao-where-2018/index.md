abstract: Approximate density functional theory (DFT) is widely used in chemistry
  and physics, despite delocalization errors that affect energetic and density properties.
  DFT+U (i.e., semilocal DFT augmented with a Hubbard U correction) and global hybrid
  functionals are two commonly employed practical methods to address delocalization
  error. Recent work demonstrated that in transition-metal complexes both methods
  localize density away from the metal and onto surrounding ligands, regardless of
  metal or ligand identity. In this work, we compare density localization trends with
  DFT+U and global hybrids on a diverse set of 34 transition-metal-containing solids
  with varying magnetic state, electron configuration and valence shell, and coordinating-atom
  orbital diffuseness (i.e., O, S, Se). We also study open-framework solids in which
  the metal is coordinated by molecular ligands, i.e., MCO3, M(OH)2, M(NCNH)2, K3M(CN)6
  (M = V–Ni). As in transition-metal complexes, incorporation of Hartree–Fock exchange
  consistently localizes density away from the metal, but DFT+U exhibits diverging
  behavior, localizing density (i) onto the metal in low-spin and late transition
  metals and (ii) away from the metal in other cases in agreement with hybrids. To
  isolate the effect of the crystal environment, we extract molecular analogues from
  open-framework transition-metal solids and observe consistent localization of the
  density away from the metal in all cases with both DFT+U and hybrid exchange. These
  observations highlight the limited applicability of trends established for functional
  tuning on transition-metal complexes even to equivalent coordination environments
  in the solid state.
