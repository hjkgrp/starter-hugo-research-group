 abstract = { Organic–inorganic hybrid materials present new opportunities for creating low-dimensional structures with unique light–matter interaction. In this work, we report a chemically robust yellow emissive one-dimensional (1D) semiconductor, silver 2,6-difluorophenylselenolate─AgSePhF2(2,6), a new member of the broader class of hybrid low-dimensional semiconductors, metal–organic chalcogenolates. While silver phenylselenolate (AgSePh) crystallizes as a two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals semiconductor, introduction of fluorine atoms at the (2,6) position of the phenyl ring induces a structural transition from 2D sheets to 1D chains. Density functional theory calculations reveal that AgSePhF2 (2,6) has strongly dispersive conduction and valence bands along the 1D crystal axis. Visible photoluminescence centered around λp ≈ 570 nm at room temperature exhibits both prompt (110 ps) and delayed (36 ns) components. The absorption spectrum exhibits excitonic resonances characteristic of low-dimensional hybrid semiconductors, with an exciton binding energy of approximately 170 meV as determined by temperature-dependent photoluminescence. The discovery of an emissive 1D silver organoselenolate highlights the structural and compositional richness of the chalcogenolate material family and provides new insights for molecular engineering of low-dimensional hybrid organic–inorganic semiconductors. }
