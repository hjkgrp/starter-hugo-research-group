abstract: In recent years, we have been witnessing a paradigm shift in computational
  materials science. In fact, traditional methods, mostly developed in the second
  half of the XXth century, are being complemented, extended, and sometimes even completely
  replaced by faster, simpler, and often more accurate approaches. The new approaches,
  that we collectively label by machine learning, have their origins in the fields
  of informatics and artificial intelligence, but are making rapid inroads in all
  other branches of science. With this in mind, this Roadmap article, consisting of
  multiple contributions from experts across the field, discusses the use of machine
  learning in materials science, and share perspectives on current and future challenges
  in problems as diverse as the prediction of materials properties, the construction
  of force-fields, the development of exchange correlation functionals for density-functional
  theory, the solution of the many-body problem, and more. In spite of the already
  numerous and exciting success stories, we are just at the beginning of a long path
  that will reshape materials science for the many challenges of the XXIth century.
