abstract: Nonheme iron halogenases, such as SyrB2, WelO5, and BesD, halogenate unactivated
  carbon atoms of diverse substrates at ambient conditions with exquisite selectivity
  seldom matched by nonbiological catalysts. Using experimentally guided molecular
  dynamics (MD) simulations augmented with multiscale (i.e., quantum mechanics/molecular
  mechanics) simulations of substrate-bound complexes of BesD and WelO5, we investigate
  substrate/active-site dynamics that enable selective halogenation. Our simulations
  reveal that active-site configurational isomerization is necessary in WelO5 to attain
  a substrate/active-site geometry consistent with its observed chemo- and regioselectivity.
  Conversely, a slight reorientation of the substrate from its crystal structure position
  is sufficient to enable regioselective chlorination in BesD without the need to
  invoke active-site isomerization. We observe very different patterns of substrate–protein
  interactions for these two enzymes, and we relate the nature of these interactions
  to the distinct substrates. For BesD, we resolve the uncertainty around the mechanistic
  relevance of Asn219. Our simulations reveal that the optimum substrate/active-site
  geometry also outweighs the interactions between the metal-oxo and the protein environment
  in facilitating the required chemoselectivity in halogenases. Our work highlights
  how different substrate-dependent strategies are used to accomplish selectivity-promoting
  proximity in halogenases.
