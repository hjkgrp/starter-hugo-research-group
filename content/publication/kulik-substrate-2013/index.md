abstract: We employ error-corrected density functional theory methods to map out the
  dependence of reactivity on substrate position for SyrB2, a member of a family of
  non-heme iron halogenases and hydroxylases that are only reactive toward amino acid
  substrates delivered via prosthetic phosphopantetheine arms. For the initial hydrogen
  abstraction step, the inherent flexibility of the phosphopantetheine molecule weakens
  the position dependence for both the native substrate (threonine for SyrB2) and
  alternative substrates. Over a 5 Ã… window of substrate positions, the tethered hydrogen
  abstraction step proceeds with nearly identical activation energies and donor-acceptor
  distances in the transition state. The propensity of a particular substrate toward
  halogenation or hydroxylation is found to depend strongly on the substrate placement
  following hydrogen abstraction, with deeper substrate delivery into the active (for
  native substrates) site favoring halogenation and shallower substrate delivery favoring
  hydroxylation.
