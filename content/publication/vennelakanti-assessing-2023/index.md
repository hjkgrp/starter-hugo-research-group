abstract: 'Spin crossover (SCO) complexes, which exhibit changes in spin state in response to external stimuli, have applications in molecular electronics and are challenging materials for computational design. We curate a data set of 95 Fe(II) SCO complexes (SCO-95) from the Cambridge Structural Database that have available low- and high-temperature crystal structures and, in most cases, confirmed experimental spin transition temperatures (T<sub>1/2</sub>). We study these complexes using density functional theory (DFT) with thirty functionals spanning across multiple rungs of “Jacob’s ladder” to understand the effect of exchange-correlation functional on electronic and Gibbs free energies associated with spin crossover. We specifically assess the effect of varying the Hartree–Fock exchange fraction (a<sub>HF</sub>) in structures and properties within the B3LYP family of functionals. We identify three best-performing functionals, a modified version of B3LYP (a<sub>HF</sub> = 0.10), M06-L, and TPSSh, that accurately predict SCO behavior for the majority of the complexes. Contrary to observations from prior studies, double-hybrids with higher a<sub>HF</sub> values are found to strongly stabilize high-spin states and therefore exhibit poor performance in predicting SCO behavior. Computationally predicted T<sub>1/2</sub> values are consistent among the three functionals but show limited correlation to experimentally reported T<sub>1/2</sub> values. These failures are attributed to the lack of crystal packing effects and counter-anions in the DFT calculations that would be needed to account for phenomena like hysteresis and two-step SCO behavior. The SCO-95 set thus presents opportunities for method development, both in terms of increasing model complexity and method fidelity.'
