abstract: Structural properties of over 55 small proteins have been determined using
  both density-based and wave-function-based electronic structure methods in order
  to assess the ability of ab initio “force fields” to retain the properties described
  by experimental structures measured with crystallography or nuclear magnetic resonance.
  The efficiency of the GPU-based quantum chemistry algorithms implemented in our
  TeraChem program enables us to carry out systematic optimization of ab initio protein
  structures, which we compare against experimental and molecular mechanics force
  field references. We show that the quality of the ab initio optimized structures,
  as judged by conventional protein health metrics, increases with increasing basis
  set size. On the other hand, there is little evidence for a significant improvement
  of predicted structures using density functional theory as compared to Hartree–Fock
  methods. Although occasional pathologies of minimal basis sets are observed, these
  are easily alleviated with even the smallest double-ζ basis sets.
