abstract: The directed depolymerization of lignin biopolymers is of utmost relevance
  for the valorization or commercialization of biomass fuels. We present a computational
  and theoretical screening approach to identify potential cleavage pathways and resulting
  fragments that are formed during depolymerization of lignin oligomers containing
  two to six monomers. We have developed a chemical discovery technique to identify
  the chemically relevant putative fragments in eight known polymeric linkage types
  of lignin. Obtaining these structures is a crucial precursor to the development
  of any further kinetic modeling. We have developed this approach by adapting steered
  molecular dynamics calculations under constant force and varying the points of applied
  force in the molecule to diversify the screening approach. Key observations include
  relationships between abundance and breaking frequency, the relative diversity of
  potential pathways for a given linkage, and the observation that readily cleaved
  bonds can destabilize adjacent bonds, causing subsequent automatic cleavage.
