abstract: Hydrogen fluoride (HF) is a versatile reagent for material remodeling, with
  applications in self-immolative polymers, remodeled siloxanes, and degradable polymers.
  The responsive, in situ generation of HF in materials therefore holds promise for
  new classes of adaptive material systems. Here, we report the mechanochemically
  coupled generation of HF from 2-methoxy-gem-difluorocyclopropane (MeO-gDFC) mechanophores
  in polymers. Pulsed ultrasonication of a MeO-gDFC containing polymer leads to one
  equivalent of HF release per MeO-gDFC activation. The mechanochemical reactivity
  of MeO-gDFC is quantified by single molecule force spectroscopy, and force-coupled
  rate constants for ring opening reach ~36 s-1 at a force of ~890 pN, 400 pN lower
  than is required in dialkyl gDFC mechanophores that lack the methoxy substituent.
  The SMFS and sonication results suggest that MeO-gDFC is a more efficient mechanophore
  source of HF than its 2-methoxy-gem-dichlorocyclopropane analog is of HCl, in contrast
  to expectations based on trends in force-free reactivity. Finally, the HF produced
  mechanically accelerates the degradation of a copolymer containing both MeO-gDFC
  (3 mol%) and an HF-cleavable silyl ether (25 mol%). The MeO-gDFC mechanophore thus
  provides a mechanically coupled mechanism of releasing HF for polymer remodeling
  pathways that complements previous thermally driven mechanisms.
