abstract: We present a detailed study of nearly 70 Zn molecular catalysts for CO2
  hydration from four diverse ligand classes ranging from well-studied carbonic anhydrase
  mimics (e.g., cyclen) to new structures we obtain by leveraging diverse hits from
  large organic libraries. Using microkinetic analysis and establishing linear free
  energy relationships, we confirm that turnover is sensitive to the relative thermodynamic
  stability of reactive hydroxyl and bound bicarbonate moieties. We observe a wide
  range of thermodynamic stabilities for these intermediates, showing up to 6 kcal/mol
  improvement over well-studied cyclen catalysts. We observe a good correlation between
  the pKa of the Zn–OH2 moiety and the resulting relative stability of hydroxyl moieties
  over bicarbonate, which may be rationalized by the dominant effect of the difference
  in higher Zn−OH bond order in comparison to weaker bonding in bicarbonate and water.
  A direct relationship is identified between isolated organic ligand pKa and the
  pKa of a bound water molecule on the catalyst. Thus, organic ligand pKa, which is
  intuitive, easy to compute or tabulate, and much less sensitive to electronic structure
  method choice than whole-catalyst properties, is a good quantitative descriptor
  for predicting the effect of through-bond electronic effects on relative CO2 hydration
  energetics. We expect this to be applicable to other reactions where is it essential
  to stabilize turnover-determining hydroxyl species with respect to more weakly bound
  moieties. Finally, we note exceptions for rigid ligands (e.g., porphyrins) that
  are observed to preferentially stabilize hydroxyl over bicarbonate without reducing
  pKa values as substantially. We expect the strategy outlined here, to (i) curate
  diverse ligands from large organic libraries and (ii) identify when ligand-only
  properties can determine catalyst energetics, to be broadly useful for both experimental
  and computational catalyst design.
