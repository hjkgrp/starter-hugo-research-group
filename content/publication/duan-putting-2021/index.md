abstract: Accelerated discovery with machine learning (ML) has begun to provide the
  advances in efficiency needed to overcome the combinatorial challenge of computational
  materials design. Nevertheless, ML-accelerated discovery both inherits the biases
  of training data derived from density functional theory (DFT) and leads to many
  attempted calculations that are doomed to fail. Many compelling functional materials
  and catalytic processes involve strained chemical bonds, open-shell radicals and
  diradicals, or metal–organic bonds to open-shell transition-metal centers. Although
  promising targets, these materials present unique challenges for electronic structure
  methods and combinatorial challenges for their discovery. In this Perspective, we
  describe the advances needed in accuracy, efficiency, and approach beyond what is
  typical in conventional DFT-based ML workflows. These challenges have begun to be
  addressed through ML models trained to predict the results of multiple methods or
  the differences between them, enabling quantitative sensitivity analysis. For DFT
  to be trusted for a given data point in a high-throughput screen, it must pass a
  series of tests. ML models that predict the likelihood of calculation success and
  detect the presence of strong correlation will enable rapid diagnoses and adaptation
  strategies. These “decision engines” represent the first steps toward autonomous
  workflows that avoid the need for expert determination of the robustness of DFT-based
  materials discoveries.
