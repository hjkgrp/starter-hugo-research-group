abstract: Selective ion separation is a major challenge with far-ranging impact from
  water desalination to product separation in catalysis. Recently introduced ferrocene
  (Fc)/ferrocenium (Fc+) polymer electrode materials have been demonstrated experimentally
  and theoretically to selectively bind carboxylates over perchlorate through weak
  C–H···O hydrogen bond (HB) interactions that favor carboxylates, despite the comparable
  size and charge of the two species. However, practical application of this technology
  in aqueous environments requires further selectivity enhancement. Using a first-principles
  discovery approach, we investigate the effect of Fc/Fc+ functional groups (FGs)
  on the selectivity and reversibility of formate–Fc+ adsorption with respect to perchlorate
  in aqueous solution. Our wide design space of 44 FGs enables identification of FGs
  with higher selectivity and rationalization of trends through electronic energy
  decomposition analysis or geometric hydrogen bonding analysis. Overall, we observe
  weaker, longer HBs for perchlorate as compared to formate with Fc+. We further identify
  Fc+ functionalizations that simultaneously increase selectivity for formate in aqueous
  environments but permit rapid release from neutral Fc. We introduce the materiaphore,
  a 3D abstraction of these design rules, to help guide next-generation material optimization
  for selective ion sorption. This approach is expected to have broad relevance in
  computational discovery for molecular recognition, sensing, separations, and catalysis.
