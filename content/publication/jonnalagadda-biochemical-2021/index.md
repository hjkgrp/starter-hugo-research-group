abstract: The isonitrile moiety is found in marine sponges and some microbes, where
  it plays a role in processes such as virulence and metal acquisition. Until recently
  only one route was known for isonitrile biosynthesis, a condensation reaction that
  brings together a nitrogen atom of l-Trp/l-Tyr with a carbon atom from ribulose-5-phosphate.
  With the discovery of ScoE, a mononuclear Fe(II) α-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase
  from Streptomyces coeruleorubidus, a second route was identified. ScoE forms isonitrile
  from a glycine adduct, with both the nitrogen and carbon atoms coming from the same
  glycyl moiety. This reaction is part of the nonribosomal biosynthetic pathway of
  isonitrile lipopeptides. Here, we present structural, biochemical, and computational
  investigations of the mechanism of isonitrile formation by ScoE, an unprecedented
  reaction in the mononuclear Fe(II) α-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase superfamily.
  The stoichiometry of this enzymatic reaction is measured, and multiple high-resolution
  (1.45–1.96 Å resolution) crystal structures of Fe(II)-bound ScoE are presented,
  providing insight into the binding of substrate, (R)-3-((carboxylmethyl)amino)butanoic
  acid (CABA), cosubstrate α-ketoglutarate, and an Fe(IV)=O mimic oxovanadium. Comparison
  to a previously published crystal structure of ScoE suggests that ScoE has an “inducible”
  α-ketoglutarate binding site, in which two residues arginine-157 and histidine-299
  move by approximately 10 Å from the surface of the protein into the active site
  to create a transient α-ketoglutarate binding pocket. Together, data from structural
  analyses, site-directed mutagenesis, and computation provide insight into the mode
  of α-ketoglutarate binding, the mechanism of isonitrile formation, and how the structure
  of ScoE has been adapted to perform this unusual chemical reaction.
