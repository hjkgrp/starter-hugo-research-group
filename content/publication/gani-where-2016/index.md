abstract: Approximate density functional theory (DFT) suffers from many-electron self-interaction
  error, otherwise known as delocalization error, that may be diagnosed and then corrected
  through elimination of the deviation from exact piecewise linear behavior between
  integer electron numbers. Although paths to correction of energetic delocalization
  error are well-established, the impact of these corrections on the electron density
  is less well-studied. Here, we compare the effect on density delocalization of DFT+U
  (i.e., semilocal DFT augmented with a Hubbard U correction), global hybrid tuning,
  and range-separated hybrid tuning on a diverse test set of 32 transition metal complexes
  and observe the three methods to have qualitatively equivalent effects on the ground
  state density. Regardless of valence orbital diffuseness (i.e., from 2p to 5p),
  ligand electronegativity (i.e., from Al to O), basis set (i.e., plane wave versus
  localized basis set), metal (i.e., Ti, Fe, Ni), and spin state, or tuning method,
  we consistently observe substantial charge loss at the metal and gain at ligand
  atoms (∼0.3–0.5 e or more). This charge loss at the metal is preferentially from
  the minority spin, leading to increasing magnetic moment as well. Using accurate
  wave function theory references, we observe that a minimum error in partial charges
  and magnetic moments occurs at higher tuning parameters than typically employed
  to eliminate energetic delocalization error. These observations motivate the need
  to develop multifaceted approximate-DFT error correction approaches that separately
  treat density delocalization and energetic errors to recover both correct density
  and orbital energy-derived properties.
