abstract: 'We report a Cu–salen helical complex ladder polymer (HLP-Cu) built from covalently fused Cu(Salen) units. Point chirality from enantiopure diamines directs the formation of a rigid, π-conjugated helix. Compared with a planar analogue (LLP-Cu) and the Cu(Salen) monomer, HLP-Cu exhibits up to 5-fold stronger circular dichroism and a maximum dissymmetry factor of 7.4 × 10⁻³. Titration experiments suggest a cooperative amplification of asymmetry arising from extended conjugation and helical geometry during helix formation. Time-dependent density functional theory calculations are employed to support this hypothesis, showing that increasing conjugation length and helical order enhance the rotational strength of contributing excited states via elevated magnetic transition moments and improved alignment of electric and magnetic transition moments. Our findings provide a new polymer platform for designing functional chiral materials with tunable chiroptical and spin-dependent properties.'
