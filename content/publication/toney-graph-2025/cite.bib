abstract = {Transition metal complexes (TMCs) are of great scientific and practical interest for applications in catalysis, biological systems, photochemistry, and sustainability, with properties highly dependent on the binding between their constituent ligands and metal center. This metal–ligand coordination is difficult to predict a priori, hindering exploration of novel, physically realistic complexes. This work introduces a large dataset of ligands known to coordinate metal centers in TMCs, analyzes observed metal–ligand coordination trends, and trains graph neural networks to accurately predict denticity and coordinating atoms from SMILES representations. The utility of our workflow as a framework for generating 3D structures of TMCs with predicted metal–ligand coordination is demonstrated in the discovery and characterization of a set of complexes. High-throughput virtual screening campaigns are invaluable for surveying the combinatorial space of possible transition metal complexes (TMCs), but they rely on accurate metal–ligand connectivity for meaningful results. Here, we curate a dataset of 70,069 unique ligands of known coordination from experimental structures of TMCs deposited in the Cambridge Structural Database. Using this dataset, we train separate graph neural network models to predict the total number and individual identities of ligand coordinating atoms with high accuracy and precision. Interpreting each model in terms of the learned molecular representations uncovers trends aligned with our understanding of coordination chemistry as well as chemical insights. Next, we integrate the trained models with the high-throughput screening software molSimplify and illustrate their utility by generating 1,175 TMCs and validating their geometries with density functional theory calculations. We anticipate these models will accelerate computational screening of TMCs with de novo combinations of metals and ligands in physically realistic coordination.}}
