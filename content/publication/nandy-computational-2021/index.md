abstract: Transition-metal complexes are attractive targets for the design of catalysts
  and functional materials. The behavior of the metal–organic bond, while very tunable
  for achieving target properties, is challenging to predict and necessitates searching
  a wide and complex space to identify needles in haystacks for target applications.
  This review will focus on the techniques that make high-throughput search of transition-metal
  chemical space feasible for the discovery of complexes with desirable properties.
  The review will cover the development, promise, and limitations of “traditional”
  computational chemistry (i.e., force field, semiempirical, and density functional
  theory methods) as it pertains to data generation for inorganic molecular discovery.
  The review will also discuss the opportunities and limitations in leveraging experimental
  data sources. We will focus on how advances in statistical modeling, artificial
  intelligence, multiobjective optimization, and automation accelerate discovery of
  lead compounds and design rules. The overall objective of this review is to showcase
  how bringing together advances from diverse areas of computational chemistry and
  computer science have enabled the rapid uncovering of structure–property relationships
  in transition-metal chemistry. We aim to highlight how unique considerations in
  motifs of metal–organic bonding (e.g., variable spin and oxidation state, and bonding
  strength/nature) set them and their discovery apart from more commonly considered
  organic molecules. We will also highlight how uncertainty and relative data scarcity
  in transition-metal chemistry motivate specific developments in machine learning
  representations, model training, and in computational chemistry. Finally, we will
  conclude with an outlook of areas of opportunity for the accelerated discovery of
  transition-metal complexes.
