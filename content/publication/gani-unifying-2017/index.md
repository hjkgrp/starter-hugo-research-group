abstract: Accurate predictions of spin-state ordering, reaction energetics, and barrier
  heights are critical for the computational discovery of open-shell transition-metal
  (TM) catalysts. Semilocal approximations in density functional theory, such as the
  generalized gradient approximation (GGA), suffer from delocalization error that
  causes them to overstabilize strongly bonded states. Descriptions of energetics
  and bonding are often improved by introducing a fraction of exact exchange (e.g.,
  erroneous low-spin GGA ground states are instead correctly predicted as high-spin
  with a hybrid functional). The degree of spin-splitting sensitivity to exchange
  can be understood based on the chemical composition of the complex, but the effect
  of exchange on reaction energetics within a single spin state is less well-established.
  Across a number of model iron complexes, we observe strong exchange sensitivities
  of reaction barriers and energies that are of the same magnitude as those for spin
  splitting energies. We rationalize trends in both reaction and spin energetics by
  introducing a measure of delocalization, the bond valence of the metal–ligand bonds
  in each complex. The bond valence thus represents a simple-to-compute property that
  unifies understanding of exchange sensitivity for catalytic properties and spin-state
  ordering in TM complexes. Close agreement of the resulting per-metal–organic-bond
  sensitivity estimates, together with failure of alternative descriptors demonstrates
  the utility of the bond valence as a robust descriptor of how differences in metal–ligand
  delocalization produce differing relative energetics with exchange tuning. Our unified
  description explains the overall effect of exact exchange tuning on the paradigmatic
  two-state FeO+/CH4 reaction that combines challenges of spin-state and reactivity
  predictions. This new descriptor-sensitivity relationship provides a path to quantifying
  how predictions in transition-metal complex screening are sensitive to the method
  used.
