abstract: Transition metal chromophores with earth-abundant transition metals are
  an important design target for their applications in lighting and non-toxic bioimaging,
  but their design is challenged by the scarcity of complexes that simultaneously
  have optimal target absorption energies in the visible region as well as well-defined
  ground states. Machine learning (ML) accelerated discovery could overcome such challenges
  by enabling screening of a larger space, but is limited by the fidelity of the data
  used in ML model training, which is typically from a single approximate density
  functional. To address this limitation, we search for consensus in predictions among
  23 density functional approximations across multiple rungs of Jacobs ladder. To
  accelerate the discovery of complexes with absorption energies in the visible region
  while minimizing MR character, we use 2D efficient global optimization to sample
  candidate low-spin chromophores from multi-million complex spaces. Despite the scarcity
  (i.e., approx. 0.01%) of potential chromophores in this large chemical space, we
  identify candidates with high likelihood (i.e., $>$ 10%) of computational validation
  as the ML models improve during active learning, representing a 1,000-fold acceleration
  in discovery. Absorption spectra of promising chromophores from time-dependent density
  functional theory verify that 2/3 of candidates have the desired excited state properties.
  The observation that constituent ligands from our leads have demonstrated interesting
  optical properties in the literature exemplifies the effectiveness of our construction
  of a realistic design space and active learning approach.
