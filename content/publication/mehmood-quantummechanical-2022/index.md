abstract: Quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) methods have become widely
  used for computational modeling of enzyme structure and mechanism. In these approaches,
  a portion of the enzyme of great interest (e.g., where a chemical reaction is occurring)
  is treated with QM, whereas the surrounding region is treated with MM. A critical
  challenge with these methods is the choice of the region to partition into QM and
  which to treat with MM along with numerous practical choices that must be made at
  each step of the modeling procedure. Here, we attempt to simplify this process by
  describing the steps involved in preparing protein structures, choosing the appropriate
  QM region size and electronic structure methods, preparing all necessary input files,
  and troubleshooting common errors for QM/MM simulations of enzymes.
