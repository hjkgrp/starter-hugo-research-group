abstract: Plants contain rapidly evolving specialized metabolic enzymes to support
  the synthesis of a myriad of functionally diverse natural products. In the case
  of coumarin biosynthesis, a BAHD acyltransferase-family enzyme COSY was recently
  discovered in Arabidopsis that catalyzes coumarin formation from o-hydroxylated
  trans-hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA substrates. COSY is the first and only BAHD enzyme known
  to date that catalyzes an intramolecular acyl transfer reaction. Here we combine
  structural, biochemical, and computational approaches to investigate the mechanistic
  basis for the unique coumarin synthase activity of COSY. Comparative analyses of
  crystal structures of Arabidopsis thaliana COSY relative to other BAHD proteins
  reveal that COSY possesses an unconventional active-site configuration adapted to
  its specialized activity. Through deuterium exchange experiments, we discover a
  unique proton exchange mechanism at the β-carbon of the o-hydroxylated trans-hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA
  substrates during the catalytic cycle of COSY. Mutagenesis studies and quantum mechanical
  cluster modeling further support that this mechanism is key to COSY’s ability to
  lower the activation energy of the trans-to-cis isomerization of the hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA
  substrates, a critical rate-limiting step leading to courmarin production. This
  study unveils the emergence of an unconventional catalytic mechanism mediated by
  a BAHD-family enzyme, and sheds light on the potential evolutionary origin of COSY
  and its recruitment to the evolutionarily new coumarin biosynthetic pathway in eudicots.
