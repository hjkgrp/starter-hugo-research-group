abstract: Highly volatile and toxic bromine (Br2) molecules can be utilized safely
  in various chemical processes when coupled with efficient separation systems. Herein,
  we present two different N-containing porous organic cages (POCs), covalent cage
  3-R (CC3-R) and formaldehyde tied-reduced covalent cage 3 (FT-RCC3), for vapor Br2
  capture under ambient conditions. They show outstanding sorption capacities (11.02
  mmol g-1 and 11.64 mmol g-1, respectively) compared with previously reported adsorbents.
  Reversibility of the Br2 sorption process has been elucidated experimentally and
  computationally by identifying bromine species adsorbed at POCs and calculating
  their binding energies. The strong charge-transfer interactions between adsorbed
  Br2 and abundant N atomic sites of the host cages led to the dominant formation
  of polybromide species (Br3- and Br5-). Further host– guest interaction between
  POCs and polybromides determined the reversibility of the Br2 sorption process—
  showing partially reversible ($>$70% recovery) behavior for CC3-R and irreversible
  ($<$10% recovery) behavior for FT-RCC3, both of which were affected by the chemical
  and structural nature of different POCs. DFT calculations further indicate that
  the formation of carbocationic species (Br3- and Br5-) and HBr is energetically
  favorable within the cage, which is in good agreement with the experimental results.
  This work demonstrates that strong host– guest interactions are essential for highly
  efficient Br2 capture and storage performance.
