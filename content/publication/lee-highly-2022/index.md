abstract: Highly volatile and toxic bromine (Br<sub>2</sub>) molecules can be utilized safely
  in various chemical processes when coupled with efficient separation systems. Herein,
  we present two different N-containing porous organic cages (POCs), covalent cage
  3-R (CC3-R) and formaldehyde tied-reduced covalent cage 3 (FT-RCC3), for vapor Br<sub>2</sub>
  capture under ambient conditions. They show outstanding sorption capacities (11.02
  mmol g<sup>-1</sup> and 11.64 mmol g<sup>-1</sup>, respectively) compared with previously reported adsorbents.
  Reversibility of the Br<sub>2</sub> sorption process has been elucidated experimentally and
  computationally by identifying bromine species adsorbed at POCs and calculating
  their binding energies. The strong charge-transfer interactions between adsorbed
  Br<sub>2</sub> and abundant N atomic sites of the host cages led to the dominant formation
  of polybromide species (Br<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> and Br<sub>5</sub><sup>-</sup>). Further host–guest interaction between
  POCs and polybromides determined the reversibility of the Br<sub>2</sub> sorption process—
  showing partially reversible (>70% recovery) behavior for CC3-R and irreversible
  (<10% recovery) behavior for FT-RCC3, both of which were affected by the chemical
  and structural nature of different POCs. DFT calculations further indicate that
  the formation of carbocationic species (Br<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> and Br<sub>5</sub><sup>-</sup>) and HBr is energetically
  favorable within the cage, which is in good agreement with the experimental results.
  This work demonstrates that strong host–guest interactions are essential for highly
  efficient Br<sub>2</sub> capture and storage performance.
