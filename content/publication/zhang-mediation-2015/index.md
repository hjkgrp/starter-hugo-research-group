abstract: Enzymatic methyl transfer, catalyzed by catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT),
  is investigated using binding isotope effects (BIEs), time-resolved fluorescence
  lifetimes, Stokes shifts, and extended graphics processing unit (GPU)-based quantum
  mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) approaches. The WT enzyme is compared with
  mutants at Tyr68, a conserved residue that is located behind the reactive sulfur
  of cofactor. Small (textgreater1) BIEs are observed for an S-adenosylmethionine
  (AdoMet)-binary and abortive ternary complex containing 8-hydroxyquinoline, and
  contrast with previously reported inverse (textless1) kinetic isotope effects (KIEs).
  Extended GPU-based computational studies of a ternary complex containing catecholate
  show a clear trend in ground state structures, from noncanonical bond lengths for
  WT toward solution values with mutants. Structural and dynamical differences that
  are sensitive to Tyr68 have also been detected using time-resolved Stokes shift
  measurements and molecular dynamics. These experimental and computational results
  are discussed in the context of active site compaction that requires an ionization
  of substrate within the enzyme ternary complex.
