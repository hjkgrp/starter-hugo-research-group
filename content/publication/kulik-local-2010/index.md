abstract: Both first-principles molecular dynamics and theoretical X-ray absorption
  spectroscopy have been used to investigate the aqueous solvation of cations in 0.5
  M MgCl2, CaCl2, and NaCl solutions. We focus here on the species-specific effects
  that Mg2+, Ca2+, and Na+ have on the X-ray absorption spectrum of the respective
  solutions. For the divalent cations, we find that the hydrogen-bonding characteristics
  of the more rigid magnesium first-shell water molecules differ from those in the
  more flexible solvation shell surrounding calcium. In particular, the first solvation
  shell water molecules of calcium are able to form acceptor hydrogen bonds, and this
  results in an enhancement of a post-edge peak near 540 eV. The absence of acceptor
  hydrogen bonds for magnesium first shell water molecules provides an explanation
  for the experimental and theoretical observation of a lack of enhancement at the
  post-main-edge peak. For the sodium monovalent cation we find that the broad tilt
  angle distribution results in a broadening of postedge features, despite populations
  in donor-and-acceptor configurations consistent with calcium. We also present the
  reaveraged spectra of the MgCl2, CaCl2, and NaCl solutions and show that trends
  apparent with increasing concentration (0.5, 2.0, 4.0 M) are consistent with experiment.
  Finally, we examine more closely both the effect that cation coordination number
  has on the hydrogen-bonding network and the relative perturbation strength of the
  cations on lone pair oxygen orbitals.
