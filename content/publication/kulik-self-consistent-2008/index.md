abstract: We present a detailed analysis of the addition-elimination reaction pathways
  for the gas-phase conversion of molecular hydrogen and methane on FeO+ to water
  and methanol, respectively, using first-principles calculations. These two reactions
  represent paradigmatic, challenging test cases for electronic structure approaches
  to transition-metal catalysis. We compare here density-functional approaches against
  state-of-the-art coupled-cluster and multireference quantum chemistry approaches.
  The quantum chemical approaches are found to be in close agreement between themselves
  as well as with the available experimental evidence. For the density-functional
  calculations, we employ a recently introduced ab initio, self-consistent Hubbard-like
  correction, coupled here with a generalized-gradient approximation (GGA) for the
  exchange-correlation functional. We find that our formulation provides a remarkable
  improvement in the description of the electronic structure, hybridization, and multiplet
  splittings for all calculated stationary points along these reaction pathways. The
  Hubbard term, which is not a fitting parameter and, in principle, can augment any
  exchange-correlation functional, brings the density-functional theory results in
  close agreement with the reference calculations. In particular, thermochemical errors
  as large as 1.4 eV in the exit channels with the GGA functional are reduced by an
  order of magnitude, to less than 0.1 eV on average; additionally, close agreement
  with the correlated-electron reference calculations and experiments are achieved
  for intermediate spin splittings and structures, reaction exothermicity, and spin
  crossovers. The role that the Hubbard U term plays in improving both quantitative
  and qualitative descriptions of transition-metal chemistry is examined, and its
  strengths as well as possible weaknesses are discussed in detail.
