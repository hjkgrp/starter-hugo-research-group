abstract: Triatomic transition-metal oxides in the “inserted dioxide” (O–M–O) structure
  represent one of the simplest examples of systems that undergo qualitative geometrical
  changes via subtle electronic-structure modulation. We consider here three transition-metal
  dioxide molecules (MO2 where M = Mn, Fe, or Co), for which the equilibrium structural
  (e.g., bent or linear geometry) and electronic (e.g., spin or symmetry) properties
  have been challenging to assign both theoretically and experimentally. Augmenting
  a standard density-functional theory (DFT) approach with a Hubbard term (DFT+U)
  occasionally overlocalizes the 3d manifold, leading to an incorrect bond elongation
  and, in turn, poor equilibrium geometries for MO2 molecules, while preserving good
  spin-state splittings. Proper description of both geometry and energetics for these
  molecules is recovered; however, through either calculating DFT+U relaxations at
  fixed M–O bond lengths or by inclusion of an intersite interaction term V that favors
  M(3d)–O(2p) interactions. In this latter case, both U and V are calculated fully
  from first-principles and are not fitting parameters. Finally, we identify an approach
  that more accurately determines the Hubbard U over a coordinate in which the covalent
  character of bonding varies.
