abstract: Colloidal quantum dots (QDs) exhibit highly desirable size- and shape-dependent
  properties for applications from electronic devices to imaging. Indium phosphide
  QDs have emerged as a primary candidate to more toxic CdSe QDs, but production of
  InP QDs with the desired properties lags behind other QD materials due to a poor
  understanding of how to tune the growth process. Using high-temperature ab initio
  molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations, we report the first direct observation of
  early-stage intermediates and subsequent formation of an InP cluster from indium
  and phosphorus precursors. In our simulations, indium agglomeration precedes formation
  of In–P bonds. We observe a predominantly intercomplex pathway in which In–P bonds
  form between one set of precursor copies, and the carboxylate ligand of a second
  indium precursor in the agglomerated indium abstracts a ligand from the phosphorus
  precursor. This process produces an indium-rich cluster with structural properties
  comparable to those in bulk zinc-blende InP crystals. Minimum energy pathway characterization
  of the AIMD-sampled reaction events confirms these observations and identifies that
  In–carboxylate dissociation energetics solely determine the barrier along the In–P
  bond formation pathway, which is lower for intercomplex (13 kcal/mol) than intracomplex
  (21 kcal/mol) mechanisms. The phosphorus precursor chemistry, on the other hand,
  controls the thermodynamics of the reaction. Our observations of the different roles
  of precursors in controlling QD formation strongly suggest that the challenges thus
  far encountered in InP QD synthesis optimization may be attributed to an overlooked
  need for a cooperative tuning strategy that simultaneously addresses the chemistry
  of both indium and phosphorus precursors.
