abstract: 'When a many-body wave function of a system deviates far from a single reference
  determinant, high-level multireference methods are required to properly explain
  the system. Multireference diagnostics to estimate the magnitude of such static
  correlation have been primarily developed for molecular systems, with a range of
  computational costs from low to as costly as the full multi-reference calculation
  itself. We report the first application of low-cost multireference diagnostics on
  the solid state based on the fractional occupation number calculated with finite-temperature
  density functional theory (DFT). In order to compare the behavior of the diagnostics
  on solids and molecules, we select metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as model materials,
  since their reticular nature provides an intuitive way of identifying molecular
  derivatives. Two possible molecular fragmentations are considered: 1) breaking it
  down into its substituent secondary building unit and linker components and 2) extracting
  it in a finite cluster with a single metal atom. We demonstrate that the DFT-based
  multireference diagnostics are equally applicable to solids as to molecules. The
  magnitude and spatial distribution of the multireference character of a MOF are
  found to have a good correlation with those of the molecular derivatives, which
  can be calculated much more affordably in comparison to the full MOF. The additivity
  feature of the multireference character discussed here suggests molecular derivatives
  as a good representation of a MOF, facilitating accurate and efficient high throughput
  screening of MOFs and other porous solids.'
