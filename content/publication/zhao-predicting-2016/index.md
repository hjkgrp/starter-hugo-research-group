abstract: We present a systematic, first-principles study of the role of elemental
  identity in determining electronic, energetic, and geometric properties of representative
  A<sub>28</sub>B<sub>28</sub>, A<sub>30</sub>B<sub>30</sub>, and A<sub>36</sub>B<sub>36</sub> III–V (A = B, Al, Ga, or In and B = N, P, or As) and
  II–VI (A = Zn or Cd and B = S or Se) fullerene allotropes. A simple descriptor comprising
  electronegativity differences and covalent radii captures the relative fullerene
  stability with respect to a nanoparticle reference, and we demonstrate transferability
  to group IV A<sub>72</sub> (A = C, Si, or Ge) fullerenes. We identify the source of relative
  stability of the four- and six-membered-ring-containing A<sub>36</sub>B<sub>36</sub> and A<sub>28</sub>B<sub>28</sub> fullerene
  allotropes to the less stable, five-membered-ring-containing A<sub>30</sub>B<sub>30</sub> allotrope. Relative
  energies of hydrogen-passivated single ring models explain why the even-membered
  ring structures are typically more stable than the A<sub>30</sub>B<sub>30</sub> fullerene, despite analogies
  to the well-known C<sub>60</sub> allotrope. The ring strain penalty in the four-membered ring
  is comparable to or smaller than the nonpolar bond penalty in five-membered rings
  for some materials, and, more importantly, five-membered rings are more numerous
  in A<sub>30</sub>B<sub>30</sub> than four-membered rings in A<sub>36</sub>B<sub>36</sub> or A<sub>28</sub>B<sub>28</sub> allotropes. Overall, we demonstrate
  a path forward for predicting the relative stability of fullerene allotropes and
  isomers of arbitrary shape, size, and elemental composition.
