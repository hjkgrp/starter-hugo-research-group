abstract: We present a systematic, first-principles study of the role of elemental
  identity in determining electronic, energetic, and geometric properties of representative
  A28B28, A30B30, and A36B36 III–V (A = B, Al, Ga, or In and B = N, P, or As) and
  II–VI (A = Zn or Cd and B = S or Se) fullerene allotropes. A simple descriptor comprising
  electronegativity differences and covalent radii captures the relative fullerene
  stability with respect to a nanoparticle reference, and we demonstrate transferability
  to group IV A72 (A = C, Si, or Ge) fullerenes. We identify the source of relative
  stability of the four- and six-membered-ring-containing A36B36 and A28B28 fullerene
  allotropes to the less stable, five-membered-ring-containing A30B30 allotrope. Relative
  energies of hydrogen-passivated single ring models explain why the even-membered
  ring structures are typically more stable than the A30B30 fullerene, despite analogies
  to the well-known C60 allotrope. The ring strain penalty in the four-membered ring
  is comparable to or smaller than the nonpolar bond penalty in five-membered rings
  for some materials, and, more importantly, five-membered rings are more numerous
  in A30B30 than four-membered rings in A36B36 or A28B28 allotropes. Overall, we demonstrate
  a path forward for predicting the relative stability of fullerene allotropes and
  isomers of arbitrary shape, size, and elemental composition.
