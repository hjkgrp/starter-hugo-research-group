abstract: Polymers that extend covalently in two dimensions have attracted recent
  attention as a means of combining the mechanical strength and in-plane energy conduction
  of conventional two-dimensional (2D) materials with the low densities, synthetic
  processability, and organic composition of their one-dimensional counterparts. Efforts
  to date have proven successful in forms that do not allow full realization of these
  properties, such as polymerization at flat interfaces or fixation of monomers in
  immobilized lattices. A frequently employed synthetic approach is to introduce microscopic
  reversibility, at the cost of bond stability, to achieve 2D crystals after extensive
  error correction. Herein we demonstrate a synthetic route to 2D irreversible polycondensation
  directly in the solution phase, resulting in covalently bonded 2D polymer platelets
  that are chemically stable and highly processable. Further fabrication offers highly
  oriented, free-standing films which exhibit exceptional 2D elastic modulus and yield
  strength at 50.9 +- 15.0 GPa and 0.976 +- 0.113 GPa, respectively. Platelet alignment
  is evidenced by polarized photoluminescence centered at 580 and 680 nm from different
  dipole transitions. This new synthetic route provides opportunities for 2D polymers
  in applications ranging from composite structures to molecular sieving membranes.
