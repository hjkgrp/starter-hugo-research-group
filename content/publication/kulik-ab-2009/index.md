abstract: Based on high-level ab initio calculations, we predict the existence of
  a strong <sup>4</sup>Σ<sup>+</sup>–<sup>4</sup>Σ<sup>+</sup> optical transition (d<sub>av</sub>=1.6 D) near 328 nm (T<sub>00</sub>=30460 cm<sup>-1</sup>), analogous
  to the B <sup>2</sup>Σ<sup>+</sup>–X <sup>2</sup>Σ<sup>+</sup> violet system, (d<sub>av</sub>=1.7 D) in the near-ultraviolet spectrum of CN.
  The lower state of the predicted transition is the lowest-lying state of quartet
  multiplicity and has been observed previously through its perturbations of the B
  state. The predicted transition will enable determination of the equilibrium properties
  of the metastable lowest quartet state of CN. The lowest energy metastable sextet
  state of CN is also calculated to be quasi-bound (r<sub>e</sub>=1.76 Å, ω<sub>e</sub>=365 cm<sup>-1</sup>), and a <sup>6</sup>Σ<sup>+</sup>–<sup>6</sup>Σ<sup>+</sup>
  transition, analogous to those for the doublet and quartet multiplicities, is predicted
  (d<sub>av</sub>=2.2 D). Investigation of the isoelectronic BO, C<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>, and N<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup> molecules reveals
  that differences in 2s<sup>2</sup>2p<sup>x</sup> and 2s<sup>1</sup>2p<sup>x+1</sup> atomic energies play the key role in determining
  the magnitude of the 5σ(2p)←4σ(2s)-derived Σ<sup>+</sup>–Σ<sup>+</sup> transition energies for the different
  multiplicities. Furthermore, the strong stabilization of 2s<sup>2</sup>2p<sup>x</sup> character with respect
  to 2s<sup>1</sup>2p<sup>x+1</sup> in BO and N<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup> leads to strongly bound lowest <sup>6</sup>Σ<sup>+</sup> states with binding
  energies as high as 2.0 eV. We believe that these newly predicted sextet states could
  be identified through their perturbations of quartet states of the relevant molecules.
