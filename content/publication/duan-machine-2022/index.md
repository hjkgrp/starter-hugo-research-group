abstract: Machine learning (ML) has become a part of the fabric of high-throughput
  screening and computational discovery of materials. Despite its increasingly central
  role, challenges remain in fully realizing the promise of ML. This is especially
  true for the practical acceleration of the engineering of robust materials and the
  development of design strategies that surpass trial and error or high-throughput
  screening alone. Depending on the quantity being predicted and the experimental
  data available, ML can either outperform physics-based modes, be used to accelerate
  such models, or be integrated with them to improve their performance. We cover recent
  advances in algorithms and in their application that are starting to make inroads
  toward (a) the discovery of new materials through large-scale enumerative screening,
  (b) the design of materials through identification of rules and principles that
  govern materials properties, and (c) the engineering of practical materials by satisfying
  multiple objectives. We conclude with opportunities for further advancement to realize
  ML as a widespread tool for practical computational materials design.
