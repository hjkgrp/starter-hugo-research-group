abstract: 'Macrocyclic, dimeric lactones have known pharmacological activities that make them attractive synthetic targets but are typically synthesized following an iterative approach. Herein, we report a visible light-mediated approach to macrocyclic dimers that allows access to 1- and 2-azetine-containing dimeric lactones. Notably, up to 30-membered macrocycles are formed following this strategy that results in 1-azetine dimers via four consecutive triplet energy transfers, while 2-azetines are formed in a sequence relying on two consecutive triplet energy transfers. Computational investigations provide important insights into the reaction mechanism, suggesting that intermolecular [2+2]-cycloadditions are preferred under non-standard Curtin-Hammett conditions over the corresponding intramolecular reaction.'
