abstract: 'Recent transformative advances in computing power and algorithms have made
  computational chemistry central to the discovery and design of new molecules and
  materials. First-principles simulations are increasingly accurate and applicable
  to large systems with the speed needed for high-throughput computational screening.
  Despite these strides, the combinatorial challenges associated with the vastness
  of chemical space mean that more than just fast and accurate computational tools
  are needed for accelerated chemical discovery. In transition-metal chemistry and
  catalysis, unique challenges arise. The variable spin, oxidation state, and coordination
  environments favored by elements with well-localized d or f electrons provide great
  opportunity for tailoring properties in catalytic or functional (e.g., magnetic)
  materials but also add layers of uncertainty to any design strategy. We outline
  five key mandates for realizing computationally driven accelerated discovery in
  inorganic chemistry: (i) fully automated simulation of new compounds, (ii) knowledge
  of prediction sensitivity or accuracy, (iii) faster-than-fast property prediction
  methods, (iv) maps for rapid chemical space traversal, and (v) a means to reveal
  design rules on the kilocompound scale. Through case studies in open-shell transition-metal
  chemistry, we describe how advances in methodology and software in each of these
  areas bring about new chemical insights. We conclude with our outlook on the next
  steps in this process toward realizing fully autonomous discovery in inorganic chemistry
  using computational chemistry.'
