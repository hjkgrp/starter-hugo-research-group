abstract = {Abstract 2D materials exhibiting in-plane anisotropy enable new applications in directional energy transport and polarized optical response. Silver phenylchalcogenides (AgEPh) – including mithrene (AgSePh), tethrene (AgTePh), and thiorene (AgSPh) – represent an exciting new addition to this family, with optical response spanning the visible to near-UV. Here, excitonic anisotropy is predicted and characterized in this family of materials using a combination of ab initio theory and optical micro-spectroscopy of single-crystalline flakes. Using density functional theory and GW with the Bethe–Salpeter equation calculations, it is revealed that all AgEPh compounds exhibit anisotropic electronic band structure and host multiple delocalized excitons with in-plane anisotropy. Room-temperature polarization-resolved optical micro-spectroscopy shows that orthogonally polarized excitons with similar energy lead to nearly isotropic absorption in AgSPh, whereas energy separation between excitonic resonances in AgSePh and AgTePh leads to strong absorption and emission anisotropy. Cryogenic reflectance micro-spectroscopy further reveals exciton fine structure in AgSePh, reconciling the discrepancies between room-temperature experiments and theoretical predictions. Finally, it is demonstrated that the optical response of thicker AgEPh crystals is influenced by photonic effects arising from finite crystal size. Overall, this work advances the understanding of the relationship between anisotropic structure, composition, and excitonic properties in AgEPh, providing a foundation for technological integration.},
