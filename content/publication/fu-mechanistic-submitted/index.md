abstract: 'Gut microbial decarboxylation of amino acid-derived arylacetates is a chemically
  challenging enzymatic transformation which generates small molecules that impact
  host physiology. The glycyl radical enzyme (GRE) indoleacetate decarboxylase from
  Olsenella uli (Ou IAD) performs the non-oxidative radical decarboxylation of indole
  3 acetate (I3A) to yield skatole, a disease-associated metabolite produced in the
  guts of swine and ruminants. Despite the importance of IAD, our understanding of
  its mechanism is limited. Here, we characterize the mechanism of Ou IAD, evaluating
  previously proposed hypotheses of: (1) a Kolbe-type decarboxylation reaction involving
  an initial 1-e– oxidation of the carboxylate of I3A or (2) a hydrogen atom abstraction
  from the α carbon of I3A to generate an initial carbon-centered radical. Site-directed
  mutagenesis, kinetic isotope effect experiments, analysis of reactions performed
  in D2O, and computational modeling are consistent with a mechanism involving initial
  hydrogen atom transfer. This finding expands the types of radical mechanisms employed
  by GRE decarboxylases and non-oxidative decarboxylases, more broadly. Elucidating
  the mechanism of IAD decarboxylation enhances our understanding of radical enzymes
  and may inform downstream efforts to modulate this disease-associated metabolism.'
