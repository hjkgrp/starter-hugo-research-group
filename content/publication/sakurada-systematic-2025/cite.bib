    abstract = { Hybrid organic–inorganic semiconductors present new opportunities for optoelectronic materials design not available in all-organic or all-inorganic materials. One example is silver phenylselenide (AgSePh) – or “mithrene” – a blue-emitting 2D organic–inorganic semiconductor exhibiting strong optical and electronic anisotropy. Here, we show that the bandgap of mithrene can be systematically tuned by introducing electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups to the phenyl ligands. We synthesized nine mithrene variants, eight of which formed 2D van der Waals crystals analogous to those of AgSePh. Density functional theory calculations reveal that these 2D mithrene variants are direct-gap or nearly direct gap semiconductors. Furthermore, we identify correlations between the optical gap and three experimental observables – the Hammett constant, 77Se chemical shift, and selenium partial charge – offering predictive power for bandgap tuning. These findings highlight new opportunities for applying the tools of chemical synthesis to semiconductor materials design. }
