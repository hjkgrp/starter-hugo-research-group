abstract: Not all nanopores are created equal. By definition, nanopores have characteristic
  diameters or conduit widths between âˆ¼1 and 100 nm. However, the narrowest of such
  pores, perhaps best called Single Digit Nanopores (SDNs) and defined as those with
  regular diameters less than 10 nm, have only recently been accessible experimentally
  for precision transport measurements. This Review summarizes recent experiments
  on pores in this size range that yield surprising results, pointing toward extraordinary
  transport efficiencies and selectivities for SDN systems. These studies have identified
  critical gaps in our understanding of nanoscale hydrodynamics, molecular sieving,
  fluidic structure, and thermodynamics. These knowledge gaps are, in turn, an opportunity
  to discover and understand fundamentally new mechanisms of molecular and ionic transport
  at the nanometer scale that may inspire a host of new technologies, from novel membranes
  for separations and water purification to new gas-permeable materials and energy
  storage devices. Here we highlight seven critical knowledge gaps in the study of
  SDNs and identify the need for new approaches to address these topics.
