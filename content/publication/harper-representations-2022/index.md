abstract: Strategies for machine-learning (ML)-accelerated discovery that are general
  across material composition spaces are essential, but demonstrations of ML have
  been primarily limited to narrow composition variations. By addressing the scarcity
  of data in promising regions of chemical space for challenging targets such as open-shell
  transition-metal complexes, general representations and transferable ML models that
  leverage known relationships in existing data will accelerate discovery. Over a
  large set (âˆ¼1000) of isovalent transition-metal complexes, we quantify evident relationships
  for different properties (i.e., spin-splitting and ligand dissociation) between
  rows of the Periodic Table (i.e., 3d/4d metals and 2p/3p ligands). We demonstrate
  an extension to the graph-based revised autocorrelation (RAC) representation (i.e.,
  eRAC) that incorporates the group number alongside the nuclear charge heuristic
  that otherwise overestimates dissimilarity of isovalent complexes. To address the
  common challenge of discovery in a new space where data are limited, we introduce
  a transfer learning approach in which we seed models trained on a large amount of
  data from one row of the Periodic Table with a small number of data points from
  the additional row. We demonstrate the synergistic value of the eRACs alongside
  this transfer learning strategy to consistently improve model performance. Analysis
  of these models highlights how the approach succeeds by reordering the distances
  between complexes to be more consistent with the Periodic Table, a property we expect
  to be broadly useful for other material domains.
