abstract: 'We present here a computational study of reactions at a model complex of
  the SyrB2 enzyme active site. SyrB2, which chlorinates l-threonine in the syringomycin
  biosynthetic pathway, belongs to a recently discovered class of α-ketoglutarate
  (αKG), non-heme Fe(II)-dependent halogenases that share many structural and chemical
  similarities with hydroxylases. Namely, halogenases and hydroxylases alike decarboxylate
  the αKG co-substrate, facilitating formation of a high-energy ferryl-oxo intermediate
  that abstracts a hydrogen from the reactant complex. The reaction mechanisms differ
  at this point, and mutation of active site residues (Asp for the hydroxylase to
  Ala or Ala to Asp/Glu for halogenase) fails to reproduce hydroxylating activity
  in SyrB2 or halogenating activity in similar hydroxylases. Using a density functional
  theory approach with a recently implemented Hubbard U correction for accurate treatment
  of transition-metal chemistry, we explore probable reaction pathways and mechanisms
  via a model complex consisting of only the iron center and its direct ligands. We
  show that the first step, αKG decarboxylation, is barrierless and exothermic, but
  the subsequent hydrogen abstraction step has an energetic barrier consistent with
  that accessible under biological conditions. In the model complex we use, radical
  chlorination is barrierless and exothermic, whereas the analogous hydroxylation
  is found to have a small energetic barrier. The hydrogen abstraction and radical
  chlorination steps are strongly coupled: the barrier for the hydrogen abstraction
  step is reduced when carried out concomitantly with the exothermic chlorination
  step. Our work suggests that the lack of chlorination in mutant hydroxylases is
  most likely due to poor binding of chlorine in the active site, whereas mutant halogenases
  do not hydroxylate for energetic reasons. Although secondary shell residues undoubtedly
  modulate the overall reactivity and binding of relevant substrates, we show that
  a small model compound consisting exclusively of the direct ligands to the metal
  can help explain reactivity heretofore not yet understood in the halogenase SyrB2.'
