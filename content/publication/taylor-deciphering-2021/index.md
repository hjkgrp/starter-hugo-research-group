abstract: We demonstrate an alternative, data-driven approach to uncovering structure–property
  relationships for the rational design of heterobimetallic transition-metal complexes
  that exhibit metal–metal bonding. We tailor graph-based representations of the metal-local
  environment for these complexes for use in multiple linear regression and kernel
  ridge regression (KRR) models. We curate a set of 28 experimentally characterized
  complexes to develop a multiple linear regression model for oxidation potentials.
  We achieve good accuracy (mean absolute error of 0.25 V) and preserve transferability
  to unseen experimental data with a new ligand structure. We also train a KRR model
  on a subset of 330 structurally characterized heterobimetallics to predict the degree
  of metal–metal bonding. This KRR model predicts relative metal–metal bond lengths
  in the test set to within 5%, and analysis of key features reveals the fundamental
  atomic contributions (e.g., the valence electron configuration) that most strongly
  influence the behavior of these complexes. Our work provides guidance for rational
  bimetallic design, suggesting that properties, including the formal shortness ratio,
  should be transferable from one period to another.
