abstract: Determination of ground-state spins of open-shell transition-metal complexes
  is critical to understanding catalytic and materials properties but also challenging
  with approximate electronic structure methods. As an alternative approach, we demonstrate
  how structure alone can be used to guide assignment of ground-state spin from experimentally
  determined crystal structures of transition-metal complexes. We first identify the
  limits of distance-based heuristics from distributions of metal–ligand bond lengths
  of over 2000 unique mononuclear Fe(II)/Fe(III) transition-metal complexes. To overcome
  these limits, we employ artificial neural networks (ANNs) to predict spin-state-dependent
  metal–ligand bond lengths and classify experimental ground-state spins based on
  agreement of experimental structures with the ANN predictions. Although the ANN
  is trained on hybrid density functional theory data, we exploit the method-insensitivity
  of geometric properties to enable assignment of ground states for the majority (ca.
  80–90%) of structures. We demonstrate the utility of the ANN by data-mining the
  literature for spin-crossover (SCO) complexes, which have experimentally observed
  temperature-dependent geometric structure changes, by correctly assigning almost
  all (textgreater95%) spin states in the 46 Fe(II) SCO complex set. This approach
  represents a promising complement to more conventional energy-based spin-state assignment
  from electronic structure theory at the low cost of a machine learning model.
