abstract: We present a systematic first-principles study of the equilibrium bond lengths,
  harmonic frequencies, dissociation energies, ground state symmetries, and spin state
  splittings of 22 diatomic molecules comprised of a first-row 3d transition-metal
  and a main-group element (H, C, N, O, or F). Diatomic molecules are building blocks
  of the key molecular bonding motifs in biological and inorganic catalytic systems,
  but, at the same time, their small size permits a thorough study by even the most
  computationally expensive quantum chemistry approaches. The results of several density-functional
  theory (DFT) approaches including hybrid, generalized-gradient, and generalized-gradient
  augmented with Hubbard U exchange-correlation functionals are presented. We compare
  these efficiently calculated DFT results with the highly accurate but computationally
  expensive post-Hartreeâ€“Fock approaches multireference configuration interaction
  (MRCI) and coupled cluster [CCSD(T)] as well as experimental values, where available.
  We show that by employing a Hubbard U approach, we systematically reduce average
  errors in state splittings and dissociation energies by a factor of 3. We are also
  able to reassign the ground state of four molecules improperly identified by hybrid
  or generalized-gradient approaches and provide correct assignment of all ground
  state symmetries as compared against experimental assignment and MRCI reference.
  By providing accuracy comparable to more expensive quantum chemistry approaches
  with the robust scaling of the generalized-gradient approximation, our DFT+U approach
  permits the study of very large scale systems with vastly improved results.
