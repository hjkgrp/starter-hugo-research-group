abstract: 'Catechol O-methyltransferase (COMT) is a SAM- and Mg2+-dependent methyltransferase
  that regulates neurotransmitters through methylation. Simulations and experiments
  have identified divergent catecholamine substrate orientations in the COMT active
  site: molecular dynamics simulations have favored a monodentate coordination of
  catecholate substrates to the active site Mg2+, and crystal structures instead preserve
  bidentate coordination along with short (2.65 Å) methyl donor-acceptor distances.
  We carry out longer dynamics (up to 350 ns) to quantify interconversion between
  bidentate and monodentate binding poses. We provide a systematic determination of
  the relative free energy of the monodentate and bidentate structures in order to
  identify whether structural differences alter the nature of the methyl transfer
  mechanism and source of enzymatic rate enhancement. We demonstrate that the bidentate
  and monodentate binding modes are close in energy but separated by a 7 kcal/mol
  free energy barrier. Analysis of interactions in the two binding modes reveals that
  the driving force for monodentate catecholate orientations in classical molecular
  dynamics simulations is derived from stronger electrostatic stabilization afforded
  by alternate Mg2+ coordination with strongly charged active site carboxylates. Mixed
  semi-empirical-classical (SQM/MM) substrate C-O distances (2.7 Å) for the bidentate
  case are in excellent agreement with COMT X-ray crystal structures, as long as charge
  transfer between the substrates, Mg2+, and surrounding ligands is permitted. SQM/MM
  free energy barriers for methyl transfer from bidentate and monodentate catecholate
  configurations are comparable at around 21–22 kcal/mol, in good agreement with experiment
  (18–19 kcal/mol). Overall, the work suggests that both binding poses are viable
  for methyl transfer, and accurate descriptions of charge transfer and electrostatics
  are needed to provide balanced relative barriers when multiple binding poses are
  accessible, for example in other transferases.'
