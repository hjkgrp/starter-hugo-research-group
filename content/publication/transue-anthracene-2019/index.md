abstract: 'Thermolysis of a pair of dibenzo-7-phosphanorbornadiene compounds is shown
  to lead to differing behaviors: phosphinidene sulfide release and formation of amorphous
  P2S. These compounds, tBuP(S)A (1, A = C14H10 or anthracene; 59% isol. yield) and
  HP(S)A (2; 63%), are available through thionation of tBuPA and the new secondary
  phosphine HPA (5), prepared from Me2NPA and DIBAL-H in 50% yield. Phosphinidene
  sulfide [tBuP═S] transfer is shown to proceed efficiently from 1 to 2,3-dimethyl-1,3-butadiene
  to form Diels–Alder product 3 with a zero-order dependence on diene. Platinum complex
  (Ph3P)2Pt(η2-tBuPS) (4, 47%) is also accessed from 1 and structurally characterized.
  In contrast, heating parent species 2 (3 h, 135 °C) under vacuum instead produces
  an insoluble, nonvolatile yellow residual material 6 of composition P2S that displays
  semiconductor properties with an optical band gap of 2.4 eV. Material 6 obtained
  in this manner from molecular precursor 2 is in a poorly characterized portion of
  the phosphorus–sulfur phase diagram and has therefore been subjected to a range
  of spectroscopic techniques to gain structural insight. X-ray spectroscopic and
  diffraction techniques, including Raman, XANES, EXAFS, and PDF, reveal 6 to have
  similarities with related compounds including P4S3, Hittorf’s violet phosphorus.
  Various possible structures have been explored as well using quantum chemical calculations
  under the constraint that each phosphorus atom is trivalent with no terminal sulfide
  groups, and each sulfur atom is divalent. The structural conclusions are supported
  by data from phosphorus-31 magic angle spinning (MAS) solid state NMR spectroscopy,
  bolstering the structural comparisons to other phosphorus–sulfur systems while excluding
  the formulation of P2S as a simple mixture of P4S3 and phosphorus.'
