abstract: ' Despite decades of effort, no earth-abundant homogeneous catalysts have
  been discovered that can selectively oxidize methane to methanol. We exploit active
  learning to simultaneously optimize methane activation and methanol release calculated
  with machine learning-accelerated density functional theory in a space of 16 M candidate
  catalysts including novel macrocycles. By constructing macrocycles from fragments
  inspired by synthesized compounds, we ensure synthetic realism in our computational
  search. Our large-scale search reveals that low-spin Fe(II) compounds paired with
  strong-field (e.g., P or S-coordinating) ligands have among the best energetic tradeoffs
  between hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) and methanol release. This observation contrasts
  with prior efforts that have focused on high-spin Fe(II) with weak-field ligands.
  By decoupling equatorial and axial ligand effects, we determine that negatively
  charged axial ligands are critical for more rapid release of methanol and that higher-valency
  metals [i.e., M(III) vs M(II)] are likely to be rate-limited by slow methanol release.
  With full characterization of barrier heights, we confirm that optimizing for HAT
  does not lead to large oxo formation barriers. Energetic span analysis reveals designs
  for an intermediate-spin Mn(II) catalyst and a low-spin Fe(II) catalyst that are
  predicted to have good turnover frequencies. Our active learning approach to optimize
  two distinct reaction energies with efficient global optimization is expected to
  be beneficial for the search of large catalyst spaces where no prior designs have
  been identified and where linear scaling relationships between reaction energies
  or barriers may be limited or unknown. '
