abstract: To accelerate exploration of chemical space, it is necessary to identify
  the compounds that will provide the most additional information or value. A large-scale
  analysis of mononuclear octahedral transition metal complexes deposited in an experimental
  database confirms an under-representation of lower-symmetry complexes. From a set
  of around 1000 previously studied Fe(II) complexes, we show that the theoretical
  space of synthetically accessible complexes formed from the relatively small number
  of unique ligands is significantly (ca. 816k) larger. For the properties of these
  complexes, we validate the concept of ligand additivity by inferring heteroleptic
  properties from a stoichiometric combination of homoleptic complexes. An improved
  interpolation scheme that incorporates information about cis and trans isomer effects
  predicts the adiabatic spin-splitting energy to around 2 kcal/mol and the HOMO level
  to less than 0.2 eV. We demonstrate a multi-stage strategy to discover leads from
  the 816k Fe(II) complexes within a targeted property region. We carry out a coarse
  interpolation from homoleptic complexes that we refine over a subspace of ligands
  based on the likelihood of generating complexes with targeted properties. We validate
  our approach on 9 new binary and ternary complexes predicted to be in a targeted
  zone of discovery, suggesting opportunities for efficient transition metal complex
  discovery.
