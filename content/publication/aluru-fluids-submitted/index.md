abstract: Confined fluids and electrolytes in nanopores exhibit rich and surprising
  physics and chemistry that impact the mass transport and energy efficiency in many
  important natural systems and industrial applications. Existing theories often fail
  to predict the exotic effects observed in the narrowest of such pores, called Single
  Digit Nanopores (SDNs), which have diameters or conduit widths of less than 10 nm
  and have only recently become accessible for experimental measurements. What SDNs
  unveil have been surprising, including a rapidly increasing number of examples such
  as extraordinarily fast water transport, distorted fluid phase boundaries, strong
  ion correlation and quantum effects, breakdown of the Nernst-Einstein relation,
  and dielectric anomalies not observed in larger pores. Exploiting these effects
  presents myriad opportunities in both basic and applied research that stand to impact
  a host of new technologies at the water-energy nexus, from new membranes for precise
  separations and water purification to new gas permeable materials for water electrolyzers
  and energy storage devices. SDNs also present unique opportunities to achieve ultrasensitive
  and selective chemical sensing at the single ion single molecule limit. In this
  review article, we summarize the progress on nanofluidics of SDNs, with a focus
  on the confinement effects that arise in these extremely narrow nanopores. The recent
  development of precision model systems, transformative experimental tools, and multi-scale
  theories that have played enabling roles in advancing this frontier are reviewed.
  We also identify new knowledge gaps in our understanding of nanofluidic transport
  and provide an outlook for the future challenges and opportunities at this rapidly
  advancing frontier.
