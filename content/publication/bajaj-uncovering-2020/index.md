abstract: Polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) represent promising energy
  storage solutions, but challenges remain to maximize their utility. Nafion is frequently
  employed as the PEMFC membrane material, but degradation of Nafion can limit the
  life of PEMFCs. Using hybrid density functional theory (DFT), we carry out reaction
  pathway analysis on a range of candidate degradation pathways on both pristine and
  defect-containing models of Nafion. Degradation of pristine Nafion initiated by
  hydrogen radicals involves moderate (ca. 20 kcal/mol) barriers lower than alternative
  pathways initiated by hydroxyl radicals. We propose a new pathway for continued
  Nafion degradation after initial H radical attack in the presence of H2O2. This
  pathway has a modest barrier and provides a mechanistic basis for the production
  of experimentally observed trifluoroacetic acid and hydrogen fluoride. Our work
  suggests inherent limits to mechanistic studies that use hydroxyl radical as the
  sole radical source to model Nafion degradation under operating conditions. We observe
  that hydroxyl-radical-only degradation mechanisms have barriers competitive with
  hydrogen radical species only for initiation at carboxylic acid defects on the main
  chain or sulfonic acid functional groups on the Nafion side chain. We confirm our
  observations with DFT by comparison to correlated wave function theory. Our study
  highlights the importance of thorough first-principles modeling to identify the
  most probable, low-energy pathways for materials degradation.
