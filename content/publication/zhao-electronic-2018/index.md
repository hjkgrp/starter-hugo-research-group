abstract: 'Indium phosphide quantum dots (QDs) have emerged as a promising candidate
  to replace more toxic II–VI CdSe QDs, but production of high-quality III–V InP QDs
  with targeted properties requires a better understanding of their growth. We develop
  a first-principles-derived model that unifies InP QD formation from isolated precursor
  and early stage cluster reactions to 1.3 nm magic sized clusters and rationalize
  experimentally observed properties of full sized textgreater3 nm QDs. Our first-principles
  study on realistic QD models reveals large surface-dependent reactivity for all
  elementary growth process steps, including In-ligand bond cleavage and P precursor
  addition. These thermodynamic trends correlate well to kinetic properties at all
  stages of growth, indicating the presence of labile and stable spots on cluster
  and QD surfaces. Correlation of electronic or geometric properties to energetics
  identifies surprising sources for these variations: short In···In separation on
  the surface produces the most reactive sites, at odds with conventional understanding
  of strain (i.e., separation) in bulk metallic surfaces increasing reactivity and
  models for ionic II–VI QD growth. These differences are rationalized by the covalent,
  directional nature of bonding in III–V QDs and explained by bond order metrics derived
  directly from the In–O bond density. The unique constraints of carboxylate and P
  precursor bonding to In atoms rationalize why all sizes of InP clusters and QDs
  are In-rich but become less so as QDs mature. These observations support the development
  of alternate growth recipes that take into account strong surface-dependence of
  kinetics as well as the shapes of both In and P precursors to control both kinetics
  and surface morphology in III–V QDs.'
