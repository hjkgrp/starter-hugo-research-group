abstract: ' Modifying the optoelectronic properties of nanostructured materials through
  the introduction of dopant atoms has attracted intense interest, but the approaches
  employed are often trial and error, preventing rational design. We demonstrate the
  power of large-scale electronic structure calculations with density functional theory
  (DFT) to build an atlas of preferred sites for a range of M(II) and M(III) dopants
  in the representative IIIâ€“V InP magic size cluster (MSC). We quantify the thermodynamic
  favorability of doping, which we identify to be both specific to the sites within
  the MSC (i.e., interior vs surface) and to the nature of the dopant atom (i.e.,
  smaller Ga(III) vs larger Y(III) or Sc(III)). For isovalent M(III) doping (i.e.,
  Y, Sc, or Ga), we observe stronger sensitivity of the predicted energetics to the
  ligand binding mode on the surface than to the dopant type. For M(II) (i.e., Zn
  or Cd) dopants, we show that the binding mode of ligand removed to balance charge
  during the doping reaction is critical. We observe limited cooperativity with dopants
  up to moderate concentrations, indicating that rapid single-dopant estimations of
  favorability from DFT can efficiently guide rational design.'
