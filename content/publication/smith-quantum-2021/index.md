abstract: ' Community efforts in the computational molecular sciences (CMS) are evolving
  toward modular, open, and interoperable interfaces that work with existing community
  codes to provide more functionality and composability than could be achieved with
  a single program. The Quantum Chemistry Common Driver and Databases (QCDB) project
  provides such capability through an application programming interface (API) that
  facilitates interoperability across multiple quantum chemistry software packages.
  In tandem with the Molecular Sciences Software Institute and their Quantum Chemistry
  Archive ecosystem, the unique functionalities of several CMS programs are integrated,
  including CFOUR, GAMESS, NWChem, OpenMM, Psi4, Qcore, TeraChem, and Turbomole, to
  provide common computational functions, i.e., energy, gradient, and Hessian computations
  as well as molecular properties such as atomic charges and vibrational frequency
  analysis. Both standard users and power users benefit from adopting these APIs as
  they lower the language barrier of input styles and enable a standard layout of
  variables and data. These designs allow end-to-end interoperable programming of
  complex computations and provide best practices options by default.'
