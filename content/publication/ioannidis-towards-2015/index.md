abstract: We estimate the prediction sensitivity with respect to Hartree-Fock exchange
  in approximate density functionals for representative Fe(II) and Fe(III) octahedral
  complexes. Based on the observation that the range of parameters spanned by the
  most widely employed functionals is relatively narrow, we compute electronic structure
  property and spin-state orderings across a relatively broad range of Hartree-Fock
  exchange (0%-50%) ratios. For the entire range considered, we consistently observe
  linear relationships between spin-state ordering that differ only based on the element
  of the direct ligand and thus may be broadly employed as measures of functional
  sensitivity in predictions of organometallic compounds. The role Hartree-Fock exchange
  in hybrid functionals is often assumed to play is to correct self-interaction error-driven
  electron delocalization (e.g., from transition metal centers to neighboring ligands).
  Surprisingly, we instead observe that increasing Hartree-Fock exchange reduces charge
  on iron centers, corresponding to effective delocalization of charge to ligands,
  thus challenging notions of the role of Hartree-Fock exchange in shifting predictions
  of spin-state ordering.
