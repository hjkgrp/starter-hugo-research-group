abstract: High-throughput computational catalyst studies are typically carried out
  using density functional theory (DFT) with a single, approximate exchange-correlation
  functional. In open shell transition metal complexes (TMCs) that are promising for
  challenging reactions (e.g., C–H activation), the predictive power of DFT has been
  challenged, and properties are known to be strongly dependent on the admixture of
  Hartree-Fock (HF) exchange. We carry out a large-scale study of the effect of HF
  exchange on the predicted catalytic properties of over 1,200 mid-row (i.e., Cr,
  Mn, Fe, Co) 3d TMCs for direct methane-to-methanol conversion. Reaction energetic
  sensitivities across this set depend both on the catalytic rearrangement and ligand
  chemistry of the catalyst. These differences in sensitivities change both the absolute
  energetics predicted for a catalyst and its relative performance. Previous observations
  of the poor performance of global linear free energy relationships (LFERs) hold
  with both semi-local DFT widely employed in heterogeneous catalysis and hybrid DFT.
  Narrower metal/oxidation/spin-state specific LFERs perform better and are less sensitive
  to HF exchange than absolute reaction energetics, except in the case of some intermediate/high-spin
  states. Importantly, the interplay between spin-state dependent reaction energetics
  and exchange effects on spin-state ordering means that the choice of DFT functional
  strongly influences whether the minimum energy pathway is spin-conserved. Despite
  these caveats, LFERs involving catalysts that can be expected to have closed shell
  intermediates and low-spin ground states retain significant predictive power.
