abstract: Many people in the materials science and solid-state community are familiar
  with the acronym “DFT+U.” For those less familiar, this technique uses ideas from
  model Hamiltonians that permit the description of both metals and insulators to
  address problems of electron over-delocalization in practical implementations of
  density functional theory (DFT). Exchange-correlation functionals in DFT are often
  described as belonging to a hierarchical “Jacob’s ladder” of increasing accuracy
  in moving from local to non-local descriptions of exchange and correlation. DFT+U
  is not on this “ladder” but rather acts as an “elevator” because it systematically
  tunes relative energetics, typically on a localized subshell (e.g., d or f electrons),
  regardless of the underlying functional employed. However, this tuning is based
  on a metric of the local electron density of the subshells being addressed, thus
  necessitating physical or chemical or intuition about the system of interest. I
  will provide a brief overview of the history of how DFT+U came to be starting from
  the origin of the Hubbard and Anderson model Hamiltonians. This history lesson is
  necessary because it permits us to make the connections between the “Hubbard U”
  and fundamental outstanding challenges in electronic structure theory, and it helps
  to explain why this method is so widely applied to transition-metal oxides and organometallic
  complexes alike.
