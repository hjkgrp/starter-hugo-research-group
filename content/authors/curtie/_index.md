Ethan joined the group as a postdoctoral fellow in September 2025. He completed his PhD at Stanford under the guidance of Todd Mart√≠nez, where his research focused primarily on the nonadiabatic dynamics of light-harvesting complexes and classical force field development. In the Kulik group, he works at the intersection between classical and machine-learned force fields.
