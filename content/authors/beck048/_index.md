Beck joined the group as a postdoctoral associate in June 2025. They received their PhD from the University of Utah in the United States with Prof. Matthew Sigman. In their PhD work, they used data science and machine learning to understand the mechanistic origins of stereoselectivity in transition metal catalysis. In the Kulik group, they are working on data-driven prediction of polymerization catalysts.
