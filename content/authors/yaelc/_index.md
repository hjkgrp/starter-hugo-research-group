Yael joined the group as a postdoc in February 2020. She received her Ph.D. at Hebrew University of Jerusalem with Prof. Roi Baer. Her dissertation was focused on a stochastic approach to thermal density functional theory within the warm dense matter regime. In the Kulik group, she is working on the interface of electronic structure method development with machine learning methods.
