Xiao joined MIT and the Kulik Group in 2021 as a PhD student in Physical Chemistry. He graduated from UCB in 2021 majoring Chemistry and Applied Math. At Cal, he worked in Prof Paul Alivisatos` lab on elucidating the synthesis and transformation of perovskite nanocrystals--through manual experiments and ML modeling. In the Kulik group, Xiao will be working on designing catalysts for polymer upcycling.
