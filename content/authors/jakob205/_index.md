Jakob is a graduate student pursuing a MS degree in chemistry at ETH Zurich. He completed his BS in chemistry there in 2022 and gained interest in the field of machine learning during his research in the group of Professor Sereina Riniker. His research involved utilizing graph neural networks to predict partial charges of drug-like molecules.  

Jakob joined the Kulik group in October 2023 as a visiting student to carry out his master’s thesis working on machine learning to predict adsorption properties of MOFs.
