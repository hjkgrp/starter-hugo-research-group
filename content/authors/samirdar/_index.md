I am a PhD student in Theoretical Chemistry and Machine Learning at the University of Stuttgart, where I also earned my Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees in Chemical Engineering. My research centers on developing machine learning approaches to elucidate chemical reactivity, with a focus on transition states and generative modeling. Prior to my doctoral studies, I worked extensively in molecular modeling with classical force fields, from their development to applying them for predicting interfacial phenomena in materials and industrial processes.
