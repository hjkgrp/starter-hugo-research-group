Huiwon is a Ph.D. student in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), where she also completed her Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees. She worked with Prof. Jihan Kim, focusing on the accelerated screening and rational design of mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) for gas separation and polymeric materials. She integrates molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and machine learning in her work, and is also exploring the application of large language models (LLMs) to enhance materials discovery workflows.

In May 2025, Huiwon joined the Kulik Group at MIT as a visiting student. Her current research involves developing machine learning frameworks to accelerate the discovery of next-generation gas separation materials based on MMMs.
