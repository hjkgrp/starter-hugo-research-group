Heecheol graduated from Seoul National University (SNU) with a major in Chemical and Biological Engineering and a minor in Materials Science and Engineering. While at SNU, he worked in Prof. Jang Wook Choi’s group, conducting experimental research on dry battery electrodes. He also worked in Prof. Won Bo Lee’s group, studying dopant screening for catalysts, reaction yield prediction, and mechanochemical reactions through computational approaches.
Building on his interest in mechanochemistry and computational studies of chemical systems, Heecheol joined the Kulik group in January 2025 as a Ph.D. student in Chemical Engineering. His research focuses on leveraging computational methods to enable the systematic design of materials and reactions, with an emphasis on mechanophores and mechanochemical reactions.
