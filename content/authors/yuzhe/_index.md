Yuzhe earned his B.S. in Materials Science and Engineering from Cornell University in 2024, where he conducted research in Prof. Yu Zhongâ€™s lab on porous organic materials for electronics. He also worked in Prof. Colin Nuckolls' lab at Columbia University, focusing on conductive macrocyclic aniline. In 2024, Yuzhe joined the Kulik and Johnson groups as a PhD student in chemistry. He seeks to use computational methods to help materials design for multiple applications.
