Tatiana obtained her M.Sc. in Theoretical and Mathematical Physics in 2024 at Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich (LMU) and Technical University of Munich (TUM), Germany. There, she worked with Prof. Dr. Lode Pollet to develop a quantum Monte Carlo approach for investigation of quantum phase transition phenomena in Rydberg systems. She also worked with Dr. Chandan Kumar and Dr. Elvira Shishenina at BMW Group in quantum chemistry and quantum computing for materials research. Her project there involved the atomic and molecular dynamics simulations of correlated molecules and investigation of chemical reactions related to vehicle battery cell performance using quantum algorithms. 

Tatiana joined the theoretical chemistry group of Prof. Dr. Christopher Stein at TUM in April 2024. As a part of collaboration with MIT, she is also a member of Kulik group. Now, she will focus on developing machine learning frameworks to enhance the accuracy of low-cost methods for modeling electrochemical processes in batteries and electrocatalysts.
