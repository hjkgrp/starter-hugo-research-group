Daniel joined the group in December 2019 as a Ph.D. student in chemical engineering. 
He graduated from UC Santa Barbara with a B.S. in chemical engineering and a minor in physics. 
As an undergraduate, Daniel primarily worked on modeling LaMer burst nucleation in the Peters group. 
He became interested in electronic structure theory while using DFT for a computational study on CO<sub>2</sub> reduction catalysts in Martin Head-Gordon's group at UC Berkeley. 
Daniel's current research in the Kulik group examines multireference character in approximate DFT and its relation to prediction error
