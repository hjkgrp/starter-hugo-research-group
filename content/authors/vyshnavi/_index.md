Vyshnavi has obtained the Master of Science degree in Chemistry from National Institute of Science Education and Research (NISER), Bhubaneswar, India, in June 2018. During her time at NISER, she worked in the field of NMR Method Development under the guidance of Prof. Arindam Ghosh on the project "Recovery of Signals Close to Solvent Resonance in Aqueous Solutions of Biomolecules" . Vyshnavi is currently pursuing her Ph.D. in the Department of Chemistry at MIT. Vyshnavi joined the Kulik group in November 2018 and her research focus in the group is to understand how non covalent interactions mediate reaction selectivity in metalloenzymes by studying these systems with electronic structure methods.
