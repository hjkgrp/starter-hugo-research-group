Roland joined the group in November 2022 as a Ph.D. student in materials science and engineering. He graduated from Cornell University with a Bachelors of Engineering in Materials Science and Engineering. During his undergradatuate education, he worked for the Wolverton group at Northwestern, on a project to machine learn the difference of formation energy between SCAN and PBE functionals. This is where he became interested in using machine learning.
