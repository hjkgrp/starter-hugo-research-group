Elizabeth joined the Kulik group in November 2024 as a Ph.D. student in Physical Chemistry. She graduated from the University of Florida in 2024, majoring in Chemistry with a Biochemistry emphasis. She conducted undergraduate research in Dr. Alberto Perez's group studying structural changes resulting from proteinâ€“peptide binding in BET proteins. As part of this work, Elizabeth developed an interest in characterizing energy landscapes through their dependence on collective variables. She aims to use this approach to understand the energetics of enzyme catalysis.
