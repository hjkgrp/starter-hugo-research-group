Giorgia is a PhD student in Data Science and Computation at the University of Bologna (UniBo) and the Italian Institute of Technology (IIT). She earned both her bachelor’s and master’s degrees in Physics at the University of Genoa, where she focused on nanoparticle-induced biomembrane fusion. Her current research centers on developing neural network potentials for protein binding sites that involve magnesium ions.

In September 2025, Giorgia joined the Kulik Group at MIT as a visiting student. Her work there focuses on machine learning force fields for biological systems containing metal ions.
