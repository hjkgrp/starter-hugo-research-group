Aditya joined the Kulik group in November 2017 as a PhD student in Chemistry. He received his B.S. in Chemical Engineering from U.C. Berkeley in Spring 2017. At Cal, Aditya worked with Prof. Jeffrey A. Reimer, using solid-state NMR and other methods to study diffusion and adsorption of small molecules inside of MOF materials. Aditya holds an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship.
