Akash obtained a Master of Technology in Chemical Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Bombay. While at IIT Bombay, he worked with Prof. Abhijit Chatterjee to develop a reverse Monte Carlo (RMC) and machine learning-based framework for the accelerated calculation of configuration free energy during gas adsorption on lattice surfaces. He also contributed to studying the relaxation dynamics in RMC and developing a novel convergence criterion. Akash graduated from Jadavpur University in India in 2020 with a Bachelor of Engineering in Chemical Engineering. 

Akash joined the Kulik group in November 2022 as a Ph.D. student in Chemical Engineering. In the Kulik lab, he will perform accelerated screening and design of metal-organic frameworks for gas storage and ion separation. Akash loves to paint, play badminton, and go hiking in his spare time.
