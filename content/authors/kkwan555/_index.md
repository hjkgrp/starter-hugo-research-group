Kwanchanok graduated with a B.Sc. in Chemistry (Physical Chemistry) from Walailak University, Thailand. She is currently pursuing an M.Sc. in Chemistry at Chulalongkorn University, Thailand, under the supervision of Dr. Boodsarin Sawatlon. Her research focuses on investigating the roles of reactants and catalysts affecting catalytic activity in the Suzuki-Miyaura C-C cross-coupling reaction.

Kwanchanok joined the Kulik group as a visiting student in the summer of 2024. She is extending her current masterâ€™s research by applying machine learning to analyze DFT data of the reaction.
