Fangzi is a 5th-year PhD student in Chemistry at ShanghaiTech University. Under the guidance of Prof. KaKing Yan, his research focuses on the mechanochemical self-assembly and transformation of supramolecules, with a particular emphasis on using mechanical force to manipulate energy diagrams and stabilize high-energy species.

In January 2025, Fangzi joined the Kulik lab as a visiting PhD student, contributing to advancing the molecular-level understanding of how supramolecular assemblies respond to mechanical force. In his free time, he enjoys photography, hiking, and cooking.
