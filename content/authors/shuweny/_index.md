Shuwen joined the group as a postdoc in October 2021. She received her Ph.D. from Princeton University with Prof. Thanos Panagiotopoulos. Her Ph.D. work focused on the prediction of thermodynamic and transport properties of aqueous electrolyte solutions. In the Kulik group, she studies water and electrolyte solutions in confinement as part of the CENT EFRC.
