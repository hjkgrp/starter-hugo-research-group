Anh graduated from the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign with a B.S. in Chemical Engineering and minor in Computational Science and Engineering. While at UIUC, she worked with Diwakar Shukla on investigating regulation by lipid bilayer composition on protein dynamics and functions using molecular dynamics. 

In Fall 2023, Anh joined the Kulik group as a PhD student in the Chemical Engineering and Computational Science & Engineering programs. Her main research focus is in leveraging accurate multi-scale modeling to better understand enzymatic systems.
