Yeongsu joined the group as a postdoc in October 2021. She received her Ph.D. at Columbia University with Prof. Timothy Berkelbach. Her PhD focused on developing semiempirical methods for excited states of nanomaterials. In the Kulik group, she is working on machine-learning-guided adaptive methods for multi-resolution materials modeling.
