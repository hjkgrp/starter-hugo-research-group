Husain grew up in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. He received a B.S. in Chemical Engineering from Tufts University in May 2020. As an undergraduate, Husain performed research in Professor Prashant Deshlahraâ€™s group where he studied structure-property relations in next-generation Group III-V semiconductors like GaAsBi using Density Functional Theory (DFT). Following this project, Husain also worked with Professor Deshlahra on the selective oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using nitric oxide as a homogeneous gas-phase catalyst. Husain joined the Kulik group in November 2020 as a Chemical Engineering PhD student and is co-advised by Professor Yuriy Roman. His research focuses on novel inorganic porous catalyst design inspired by biological enzymes.
