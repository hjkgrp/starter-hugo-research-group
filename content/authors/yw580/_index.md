Gigi graduated from the Johns Hopkins University with a double major in Chemical & Biomolecular Engineering and Computer Science. While at Hopkins, she worked with Prof. Paulette Clancy on developing Bayesian Optimization method to accelerate material discovery. She also worked at Merck as a Rosetta intern on computational sampling of cyclic peptides. In Fall 2024, Gigi joined the Kulik group as a PhD student in the Chemical Engineering and Computational Science & Engineering program. Her research focuses on leveraging computational methods to design and optimize excited state properties of transition metal complexes.
