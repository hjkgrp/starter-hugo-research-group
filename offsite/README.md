## Onboarding
1. Download/copy the `member_template.md` file in this folder
    1. Fill out the fields in curly braces, e.g. {example}
    2. The {bio} field should be a few sentences about yourself. Click on anyone's page on [our website]{http://hjkgrp.mit.edu/people/} to see an example.
    3. Social links are optional
2. Pick a picture of yourself to display on the website
3. Optionally, prepare a PDF of your CV.

Once you have everything ready, if you are not set up on the group GitHub, send the files to the website manager.
Otherwise,
1. Make a folder [here](../people/content/authors) named by your Kerberos ID (MIT email without the @mit.edu)
2. In the created folder
    1. Upload the filled out `member_template.md` file as `_index.md`
    2. Upload your picture with the name "avatar" (e.g. `avatar.png` or `avatar.jpg`)
3. If you upload a CV, it should be placed [here](../people/static/files).
4. Open a pull request to merge the `people` branch to the `main` branch and let the website manager know.
