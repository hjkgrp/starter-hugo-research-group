 abstract = {Confined fluids and electrolytes in nanopores exhibit rich and surprising physics and chemistry that impact the mass transport and energy efficiency in many important natural systems and industrial applications. Existing theories often fail to predict the exotic effects observed in the narrowest of such pores, called Single Digit Nanopores (SDNs), which have diameters or conduit widths of less than 10 nm and have only recently become accessible for experimental measurements. What SDNs unveil have been surprising, including a rapidly increasing number of examples such as extraordinarily fast water transport, distorted fluid phase boundaries, strong ion correlation and quantum effects, breakdown of the Nernst-Einstein relation, and dielectric anomalies not observed in larger pores. Exploiting these effects presents myriad opportunities in both basic and applied research that stand to impact a host of new technologies at the water-energy nexus, from new membranes for precise separations and water purification to new gas permeable materials for water electrolyzers and energy storage devices. SDNs also present unique opportunities to achieve ultrasensitive and selective chemical sensing at the single ion single molecule limit. In this review article, we summarize the progress on nanofluidics of SDNs, with a focus on the confinement effects that arise in these extremely narrow nanopores. The recent development of precision model systems, transformative experimental tools, and multi-scale theories that have played enabling roles in advancing this frontier are reviewed. We also identify new knowledge gaps in our understanding of nanofluidic transport and provide an outlook for the future challenges and opportunities at this rapidly advancing frontier.},

 abstract = {The flat-plane condition is the union of two exact constraints in electronic structure theory: (i) energetic piecewise linearity with fractional electron removal or addition and (ii) invariant energetics with change in electron spin in a half filled orbital. Semi-local density functional theory (DFT) fails to recover the flat plane, exhibiting convex fractional charge errors (FCE) and concave fractional spin errors (FSE) that are related to delocalization and static correlation errors. We previously showed that DFT+U eliminates FCE but now demonstrate that, like other widely employed corrections (i.e., Hartree-Fock exchange), it worsens FSE. To find an alternative strategy, we examine the shape of semi-local DFT deviations from the exact flat plane and we find this shape to be remarkably consistent across ions and molecules. We introduce the judiciously modified DFT (jmDFT) approach, wherein corrections are constructed from few-parameter, low-order functional forms that fit the shape of semi-local DFT errors. We select one such physically intuitive form and incorporate it self-consistently to correct semi-local DFT. We demonstrate on model systems that jmDFT represents the first easy-to-implement, no-overhead approach to recovering the flat plane from semi-local DFT.},

 abstract = { Approximate semilocal density functional theory (DFT) is known to underestimate surface formation energies yet paradoxically overbind adsorbates on catalytic transition-metal oxide surfaces due to delocalization error. The low-cost DFT + U approach only improves surface formation energies for early transition-metal oxides or adsorption energies for late transition-metal oxides. In this work, we demonstrate that this inefficacy arises due to the conventional usage of metal-centered atomic orbitals as projectors within DFT + U. We analyze electron density rearrangement during surface formation and O atom adsorption on rutile transition-metal oxides to highlight that a standard DFT + U correction fails to tune properties when the corresponding density rearrangement is highly delocalized across both metal and oxygen sites. To improve both surface properties simultaneously while retaining the simplicity of a single-site DFT + U correction, we systematically construct multi-atom-centered molecular-orbital-like projectors for DFT + U. We demonstrate this molecular DFT + U approach for tuning adsorption energies and surface formation energies of minimal two-dimensional models of representative early (i.e., TiO2) and late (i.e., PtO2) transition-metal oxides. Molecular DFT + U simultaneously corrects adsorption energies and surface formation energies of multilayer models of rutile TiO2(110) and PtO2(110) to resolve the paradoxical description of surface stability and surface reactivity of semilocal DFT.},

 abstract = {While density functional theory (DFT) is widely applied for its combination of cost and accuracy, corrections (e.g., DFT+U) that improve it are often needed to tackle correlated transition-metal chemistry. In principle, the functional form of DFT+U, consisting of a set of localized atomic orbitals (AOs) and a quadratic energy penalty for deviation from integer occupations of those AOs, enables the recovery of the exact conditions of piecewise linearity and the derivative discontinuity. Nevertheless, for practical transition-metal complexes, where both atomic states and ligand orbitals participate in bonding, standard DFT+U can fail to eliminate delocalization error (DE). Here, we show that by introducing an alternative valence-state (i.e., molecular orbital or MO) basis to the DFT+U approach, we recover exact conditions in cases for which standard DFT+U corrections have no error-reducing effect. This MO-based DFT+U also eliminates DE where standard AO-based DFT+U is already successful. We demonstrate the transferability of our approach on representative transition-metal complexes with a range of ligand field strengths, electron configurations (i.e., from Sc to Zn), and spin states.},

@article{bajaj_non-empirical_2019,
 abstract = {Density functional theory (DFT) is widely applied to both molecules and materials, but well known energetic delocalization and static correlation errors in practical exchange-correlation approximations limit quantitative accuracy. Common methods that correct energetic delocalization errors, such as the Hubbard U correction in DFT+U or Hartree-Fock exchange in global hybrids, do so at the cost of worsening static correlation errors. We recently introduced an alternate approach [Bajaj et al., J. Chem. Phys. 147, 191101 (2017)] known as judiciously modified DFT (jmDFT), wherein the deviation from exact behavior of semilocal functionals over both fractional spin and charge, i.e., the so-called flat plane, was used to motivate functional forms of second order analytic corrections. In this work, we introduce fully nonempirical expressions for all four coefficients in a DFT+U+J-inspired form of jmDFT, where all coefficients are obtained only from energies and eigenvalues of the integer-electron systems. We show good agreement for U and J coefficients obtained nonempirically as compared with the results of numerical fitting in a jmDFT U+J/J′ correction. Incorporating the fully nonempirical jmDFT correction reduces and even eliminates the fractional spin error at the same time as eliminating the energetic delocalization error. We show that this approach extends beyond s-electron systems to higher angular momentum cases including p- and d-electrons. Finally, we diagnose some shortcomings of the current jmDFT approach that limit its ability to improve upon DFT results for cases such as weakly bound anions due to poor underlying semilocal functional behavior.},

@article{bajaj_uncovering_2020,
 abstract = {Polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) represent promising energy storage solutions, but challenges remain to maximize their utility. Nafion is frequently employed as the PEMFC membrane material, but degradation of Nafion can limit the life of PEMFCs. Using hybrid density functional theory (DFT), we carry out reaction pathway analysis on a range of candidate degradation pathways on both pristine and defect-containing models of Nafion. Degradation of pristine Nafion initiated by hydrogen radicals involves moderate (ca. 20 kcal/mol) barriers lower than alternative pathways initiated by hydroxyl radicals. We propose a new pathway for continued Nafion degradation after initial H radical attack in the presence of H2O2. This pathway has a modest barrier and provides a mechanistic basis for the production of experimentally observed trifluoroacetic acid and hydrogen fluoride. Our work suggests inherent limits to mechanistic studies that use hydroxyl radical as the sole radical source to model Nafion degradation under operating conditions. We observe that hydroxyl-radical-only degradation mechanisms have barriers competitive with hydrogen radical species only for initiation at carboxylic acid defects on the main chain or sulfonic acid functional groups on the Nafion side chain. We confirm our observations with DFT by comparison to correlated wave function theory. Our study highlights the importance of thorough first-principles modeling to identify the most probable, low-energy pathways for materials degradation.},

 abstract = {The immobilization of homogeneous catalysts onto supports to improve recyclability while maintaining catalytic efficiency is often a trial-and-error process limited by poor control of the local catalyst environment and few strategies to append catalysts to support materials. Here, we introduce a modular heterogenous catalysis platform that addresses these challenges. Our approach leverages the well-defined interiors of self-assembled Pd12L24 metal–organic cages/polyhedra (MOCs): simple mixing of a catalyst-ligand of choice with a polymeric ligand, spacer ligands, and a Pd salt induces self-assembly of Pd12L24-cross-linked polymer gels featuring endohedrally catalyst-functionalized junctions. Semi-empirical calculations show that catalyst incorporation into the MOC junctions of these materials has minimal affect on the MOC geometry, giving rise to well-defined nanoconfined catalyst domains as confirmed experimentally using several techniques. Given the unique network topology of these freestanding gels, they are mechanically robust regardless of their endohedral catalyst composition, allowing them to be physically manipulated and transferred from one reaction to another to achieve multiple rounds of catalysis. Moreover, by decoupling the catalyst environment (interior of MOC junctions) from the physical properties of the support (the polymer matrix), this strategy enables catalysis in environments where homogeneous catalyst analogues are not viable, as demonstrated for the Au(I)-catalyzed cyclization of 4-pentynoic acid in aqueous media.},

 abstract = {Mononuclear non-heme Fe(II)- and alpha-ketoglutarate dependent oxygenases (FeDOs) catalyze site-selective C-H hydroxylation. Variants of these enzymes in which a conserved Asp/Glu residue in the Fe(II)-binding facial triad is replaced by Ala/Gly can, in some cases, bind various anionic ligands and catalyze non-native chlorination and bromination reactions. In this study, we explore the binding of different anions to a FeDO facial triad variant, SadX, and the effects of that binding on HO• vs. X• rebound. We establish that chloride and bromide not only enable non-native halogenation reactions but that all anions investigated, including azide, cyanate, formate, and fluoride, significantly accelerate and influence the site selectivity of SadX hydroxylation catalysis. Azide and cyanate also lead to the formation of products resulting from N3•, NCO•, and OCN• rebound. While fluoride rebound is not observed, the rate acceleration provided by this ligand led us to calculate barriers for HO• and F• rebound from a putative Fe(III)(OH)(F) intermediate. These calculations suggest that the lack of fluorination is due to the relative barriers of the HO• and F• rebound transition states rather than an inaccessible barrier for F• rebound. Together, these results improve our understanding of FeDO facial triad variant tolerance of different anionic ligands, their ability to promote rebound involving those ligands, and inherent rebound preferences relative to HO• that will aid efforts to develop non-native catalysis using these enzymes.},

 abstract = {The predictive accuracy of density functional theory (DFT) is hampered by delocalization errors, especially for correlated systems such as transition-metal complexes. Two complementary strategies have been developed to reduce delocalization error: eliminating the global curvature with change in charge and computing a linear response Hubbard U as a measure of local curvature at the metal center at fixed charge and applying it to the transition-metal complex in a DFT+U framework. We investigate the relationship between the two delocalization error measures as the ligand field strength is varied with the number of strong-field ligands in a series of heteroleptic complexes or by geometrically constraining the metal–ligand bond length in homoleptic octahedral complexes. We show that across these sets of complexes an inverse relationship generally exists between global and local curvatures. We find that effects of ligand substitution on both measures of delocalization are typically additive, but the quantities seldom coincide.},

In comparison with other GREs, alternate positioning of the active site β strands allows for distinct residue positions to contribute to substrate binding. These structural differences, combined with sequence variations, create a highly tailored active site for the binding of the negatively charged isethionate substrate. Through the kinetic analysis of 14 IslA variants and computational analyses, we probe the mechanism by which radical chemistry is used for C-S bond cleavage.

Isonitrile biosynthesis was restricted for over a decade to isonitrile synthases, a family of enzymes catalyzing a condensation reaction between l-Trp/l-Tyr and ribulose-5-phosphate. The discovery of ScoE, a non-heme iron(II) and α-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase, demonstrated an alternative pathway employed by nature for isonitrile installation. Biochemical, crystallographic, and computational investigations of ScoE have previously been reported, yet the isonitrile formation mechanism remains obscure. In the present work, we employed in vitro biochemistry, chemical synthesis, spectroscopy techniques, and computational simulations that enabled us to propose a plausible molecular mechanism for isonitrile formation. Our findings demonstrate that the ScoE reaction initiates with C5 hydroxylation of (R)-3-((carboxymethyl)amino)butanoic acid to generate 1, which undergoes dehydration, presumably mediated by Tyr96 to synthesize 2 in a trans configuration. (R)-3-isocyanobutanoic acid is finally generated through radical-based decarboxylation of 2, instead of the common hydroxylation pathway employed by this enzyme superfamily.},

When biomaterials are damaged as a result of aging or stress, tissues undergo repair by a depolymerization–repolymerization sequence of remodelling. Integration of this concept into synthetic materials systems may lead to devices with extended lifetimes. Here, we show that a metastable polymer, end-capped poly(o-phthalaldehyde), undergoes mechanically initiated depolymerization to revert the material to monomers. Trapping experiments and steered molecular dynamics simulations are consistent with a heterolytic scission mechanism. The obtained monomer was repolymerized by a chemical initiator, effectively completing a depolymerization–repolymerization cycle.

 abstract = {High-throughput computational screening typically employs methods (i.e., density functional theory or DFT) that can fail to describe challenging molecules, such as those with strongly correlated electronic structure. In such cases, multireference (MR) correlated wavefunction theory (WFT) would be the appropriate choice but remains more challenging to carry out and automate than single-reference (SR) WFT or DFT. Numerous diagnostics have been proposed for identifying when MR character is likely to have an effect on the predictive power of SR calculations, but conflicting conclusions about diagnostic performance have been reached on small data sets. We compute 15 MR diagnostics, ranging from affordable DFT-based to more costly MR-WFT-based diagnostics, on a set of 3165 equilibrium and distorted small organic molecules containing up to six heavy atoms. Conflicting MR character assignments and low pairwise linear correlations among diagnostics are also observed over this set. We evaluate the ability of existing diagnostics to predict the percent recovery of the correlation energy, %Ecorr. None of the DFT-based diagnostics are nearly as predictive of %Ecorr as the best WFT-based diagnostics. To overcome the limitation of this cost–accuracy trade-off, we develop machine learning (ML, i.e., kernel ridge regression) models to predict WFT-based diagnostics from a combination of DFT-based diagnostics and a new, size-independent 3D geometric representation. The ML-predicted diagnostics correlate as well with MR effects as their computed (i.e., with WFT) values, significantly improving over the DFT-based diagnostics on which the models were trained. These ML models thus provide a promising approach to improve upon DFT-based diagnostic accuracy while remaining suitably low cost for high-throughput screening.},

Despite development of numerous MR diagnostics, the extent to which a single value of such a diagnostic indicates the MR effect on a chemical property prediction is not well established. We evaluate MR diagnostics for over 10 000 transition-metal complexes (TMCs) and compare to those for organic molecules. We observe that only some MR diagnostics are transferable from one chemical space to another. By studying the influence of MR character on chemical properties (i.e., MR effect) that involve multiple potential energy surfaces (i.e., adiabatic spin splitting, ΔEH–L, and ionization potential, IP), we show that differences in MR character are more important than the cumulative degree of MR character in predicting the magnitude of an MR effect. Motivated by this observation, we build transfer learning models to predict CCSD(T)-level adiabatic ΔEH–L and IP from lower levels of theory. By combining these models with uncertainty quantification and multi-level modeling, we introduce a multi-pronged strategy that accelerates data acquisition by at least a factor of three while achieving coupled cluster accuracy (i.e., to within 1 kcal mol−1 MAE) for robust VHTS.},

To accomplish this task, we introduce an iterative approach for consistent ligand charge assignment for ligands in the CSD. Across this set, we observe that MR character correlates linearly with the inverse value of the averaged bond order over all bonds in the molecule. We then demonstrate that ligand additivity of MR character holds in TMCs, which suggests that the TMC MR character can be inferred from the sum of the MR character of the ligands. Encouraged by this observation, we leverage ligand additivity and develop a ligand-derived machine learning representation to train neural networks to predict the MR character of TMCs from properties of the constituent ligands.

To overcome this challenge toward realizing fully automated chemical discovery in transition metal chemistry, we have developed the first machine learning models that predict the likelihood of successful simulation outcomes. We train support vector machine and artificial neural network classifiers to predict simulation outcomes (i.e., geometry optimization result and degree of ⟨S2⟩ deviation) for a chosen electronic structure method based on chemical composition. For these static models, we achieve an area under the curve of at least 0.95, minimizing computational time spent on nonproductive simulations and therefore enabling efficient chemical space exploration. We introduce a metric of model uncertainty based on the distribution of points in the latent space to systematically improve model prediction confidence. In a complementary approach, we train a convolutional neural network classification model on simulation output electronic and geometric structure time series data. This dynamic model generalizes more readily than the static classifier by becoming more predictive as input simulation length increases. Finally, we describe approaches for using these models to enable autonomous job control in transition metal complex discovery.},

 abstract = {Virtual high-throughput screening (VHTS) with density functional theory (DFT) and machine-learning (ML)-acceleration is essential in rapid materials discovery. By necessity, efficient DFT-based workflows are carried out with a single density functional approximation (DFA). Nevertheless, properties evaluated with different DFAs can be expected to disagree for cases with challenging electronic structure (e.g., open-shell transition-metal complexes, TMCs) for which rapid screening is most needed and accurate benchmarks are often unavailable. To quantify the effect of DFA bias, we introduce an approach to rapidly obtain property predictions from 23 representative DFAs spanning multiple families, “rungs” (e.g., semi-local to double hybrid) and basis sets on over 2000 TMCs. Although computed property values (e.g., spin state splitting and frontier orbital gap) differ by DFA, high linear correlations persist across all DFAs. We train independent ML models for each DFA and observe convergent trends in feature importance, providing DFA-invariant, universal design rules. We devise a strategy to train artificial neural network (ANN) models informed by all 23 DFAs and use them to predict properties (e.g., spin-splitting energy) of over 187k TMCs. By requiring consensus of the ANN-predicted DFA properties, we improve correspondence of computational lead compounds with literature-mined, experimental compounds over the typically employed single-DFA approach.},

This is especially true for the practical acceleration of the engineering of robust materials and the development of design strategies that surpass trial and error or high-throughput screening alone. Depending on the quantity being predicted and the experimental data available, ML can either outperform physics-based modes, be used to accelerate such models, or be integrated with them to improve their performance. We cover recent advances in algorithms and in their application that are starting to make inroads toward (a) the discovery of new materials through large-scale enumerative screening, (b) the design of materials through identification of rules and principles that govern materials properties, and (c) the engineering of practical materials by satisfying multiple objectives.

 abstract = {Virtual high-throughput screening (VHTS) and machine learning (ML) have greatly accelerated the design of single-site transition-metal catalysts. VHTS of catalysts, however, is often accompanied with high calculation failure rate and wasted computational resources due to the difficulty of simultaneously converging all mechanistically relevant reactive intermediates to expected geometries and electronic states. We demonstrate a dynamic classifier approach, i.e., a convolutional neural network that monitors geometry optimizations on the fly, and exploit its good performance and transferability on identifying geometry optimization failures for catalyst design. We show that the dynamic classifier performs well on all reactive intermediates in the representative catalytic cycle of the radical rebound mechanism for the conversion of methane to methanol despite being trained on only one reactive intermediate. The dynamic classifier also generalizes to chemically distinct intermediates and metal centers absent from the training data without loss of accuracy or model confidence. We rationalize this superior model transferability as arising from the use of on-the-fly electronic structure and geometric information generated from on-the-fly density functional theory calculations and the convolutional layer in the dynamic classifier. When used in combination with uncertainty quantification, the dynamic classifier saves more than half of the computational resources that would have been wasted on unsuccessful calculations for all reactive intermediates being considered.},

Nevertheless, ML-accelerated discovery both inherits the biases of training data derived from density functional theory (DFT) and leads to many attempted calculations that are doomed to fail. Many compelling functional materials and catalytic processes involve strained chemical bonds, open-shell radicals and diradicals, or metal–organic bonds to open-shell transition-metal centers. Although promising targets, these materials present unique challenges for electronic structure methods and combinatorial challenges for their discovery. In this Perspective, we describe the advances needed in accuracy, efficiency, and approach beyond what is typical in conventional DFT-based ML workflows. These challenges have begun to be addressed through ML models trained to predict the results of multiple methods or the differences between them, enabling quantitative sensitivity analysis. For DFT to be trusted for a given data point in a high-throughput screen, it must pass a series of tests. ML models that predict the likelihood of calculation success and detect the presence of strong correlation will enable rapid diagnoses and adaptation strategies. These “decision engines” represent the first steps toward autonomous workflows that avoid the need for expert determination of the robustness of DFT-based materials discoveries.},

 abstract = {Multireference (MR) diagnostics are common tools for identifying strongly correlated electronic structure that makes single-reference (SR) methods (e.g., density functional theory or DFT) insufficient for accurate property prediction. However, MR diagnostics typically require computationally demanding correlated wave function theory (WFT) calculations, and diagnostics often disagree or fail to predict MR effects on properties. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a semi-supervised machine learning (ML) approach with virtual adversarial training (VAT) of an MR classifier using 15 WFT and DFT MR diagnostics as inputs. In semi-supervised learning, only the most extreme SR or MR points are labeled, and the remaining point labels are learned. The resulting VAT model outperforms the alternatives, as quantified by the distinct property distributions of SR- and MR-classified molecules. To reduce the cost of generating inputs to the VAT model, we leverage the VAT model’s robustness to noisy inputs by replacing WFT MR diagnostics with regression predictions in an MR decision engine workflow that preserves excellent performance. We demonstrate the transferability of our approach to larger molecules and those with distinct chemical composition from the training set. This MR decision engine demonstrates promise as a low-cost, high-accuracy approach to the automatic detection of strong correlation for predictive high-throughput screening.},

To date, however, no single density functional approximation (DFA) with universal accuracy has been identified, leading to uncertainty in the quality of data generated from DFT. With electron density fitting and transfer learning, we build a DFA recommender that selects the DFA with the lowest expected error with respect to gold standard but cost-prohibitive coupled cluster theory in a system-specific manner. We demonstrate this recommender approach on vertical spin-splitting energy evaluation for challenging transition metal complexes. Our recommender predicts top-performing DFAs and yields excellent accuracy (ca. 2 kcal/mol) for chemical discovery, outperforming both individual transfer learning models and the single best functional in a set of 48 DFAs.

However, the narrowest of such pores, perhaps best called Single Digit Nanopores (SDNs) and defined as those with regular diameters less than 10 nm, have only recently been accessible experimentally for precision transport measurements. This Review summarizes recent experiments on pores in this size range that yield surprising results, pointing toward extraordinary transport efficiencies and selectivities for SDN systems. These studies have identified critical gaps in our understanding of nanoscale hydrodynamics, molecular sieving, fluidic structure, and thermodynamics. These knowledge gaps are, in turn, an opportunity to discover and understand fundamentally new mechanisms of molecular and ionic transport at the nanometer scale that may inspire a host of new technologies, from novel membranes for separations and water purification to new gas-permeable materials and energy storage devices. Here we highlight seven critical knowledge gaps in the study of SDNs and identify the need for new approaches to address these topics.},

 abstract = {Gut microbial decarboxylation of amino acid-derived arylacetates is a chemically challenging enzymatic transformation which generates small molecules that impact host physiology. The glycyl radical enzyme (GRE) indoleacetate decarboxylase from Olsenella uli (Ou IAD) performs the non-oxidative radical decarboxylation of indole 3 acetate (I3A) to yield skatole, a disease-associated metabolite produced in the guts of swine and ruminants. Despite the importance of IAD, our understanding of its mechanism is limited. Here, we characterize the mechanism of Ou IAD, evaluating previously proposed hypotheses of: (1) a Kolbe-type decarboxylation reaction involving an initial 1-e– oxidation of the carboxylate of I3A or (2) a hydrogen atom abstraction from the α carbon of I3A to generate an initial carbon-centered radical. Site-directed mutagenesis, kinetic isotope effect experiments, analysis of reactions performed in D2O, and computational modeling are consistent with a mechanism involving initial hydrogen atom transfer. This finding expands the types of radical mechanisms employed by GRE decarboxylases and non-oxidative decarboxylases, more broadly. Elucidating the mechanism of IAD decarboxylation enhances our understanding of radical enzymes and may inform downstream efforts to modulate this disease-associated metabolism.},

Recently introduced ferrocene (Fc)/ferrocenium (Fc+) polymer electrode materials have been demonstrated experimentally and theoretically to selectively bind carboxylates over perchlorate through weak C–H···O hydrogen bond (HB) interactions that favor carboxylates, despite the comparable size and charge of the two species. However, practical application of this technology in aqueous environments requires further selectivity enhancement. Using a first-principles discovery approach, we investigate the effect of Fc/Fc+ functional groups (FGs) on the selectivity and reversibility of formate–Fc+ adsorption with respect to perchlorate in aqueous solution. Our wide design space of 44 FGs enables identification of FGs with higher selectivity and rationalization of trends through electronic energy decomposition analysis or geometric hydrogen bonding analysis. Overall, we observe weaker, longer HBs for perchlorate as compared to formate with Fc+. We further identify Fc+ functionalizations that simultaneously increase selectivity for formate in aqueous environments but permit rapid release from neutral Fc. We introduce the materiaphore, a 3D abstraction of these design rules, to help guide next-generation material optimization for selective ion sorption. This approach is expected to have broad relevance in computational discovery for molecular recognition, sensing, separations, and catalysis.},

 abstract = {Computational high-throughput screening is an essential tool for catalyst design, limited primarily by the efficiency with which accurate predictions can be made. In bulk heterogeneous catalysis, linear free energy relationships (LFERs) have been extensively developed to relate elementary step activation energies, and thus overall catalytic activity, back to the adsorption energies of key intermediates, dramatically reducing the computational cost of screening. The applicability of these LFERs to single-site catalysts remains unclear, owing to the directional, covalent metal–ligand bonds and the broader chemical space of accessible ligand scaffolds. Through a computational screen of nearly 500 model Fe(II) complexes for CH4 hydroxylation, we observe that (1) tuning ligand field strength yields LFERs by comparably shifting energetics of the metal 3d levels that govern the stability of different intermediates and (2) distortion of the metal coordination geometry breaks these LFERs by increasing the splitting between the dxz/dyz and dz2 metal states that govern reactivity. Thus, in single-site catalysts, low Brønsted–Evans–Polanyi slopes for oxo formation, which would limit peak turnover frequency achievable through ligand field tuning alone, can be overcome through structural distortions achievable in experimentally characterized compounds. Observations from this screen also motivate the placement of strong HB donors in targeted positions as a scaffold-agnostic strategy for further activity improvement. More generally, our findings motivate broader variation of coordination geometries in reactivity studies with single-site catalysts.},

 abstract = {Accurate predictions of spin-state ordering, reaction energetics, and barrier heights are critical for the computational discovery of open-shell transition-metal (TM) catalysts. Semilocal approximations in density functional theory, such as the generalized gradient approximation (GGA), suffer from delocalization error that causes them to overstabilize strongly bonded states. Descriptions of energetics and bonding are often improved by introducing a fraction of exact exchange (e.g., erroneous low-spin GGA ground states are instead correctly predicted as high-spin with a hybrid functional). The degree of spin-splitting sensitivity to exchange can be understood based on the chemical composition of the complex, but the effect of exchange on reaction energetics within a single spin state is less well-established. Across a number of model iron complexes, we observe strong exchange sensitivities of reaction barriers and energies that are of the same magnitude as those for spin splitting energies. We rationalize trends in both reaction and spin energetics by introducing a measure of delocalization, the bond valence of the metal–ligand bonds in each complex. The bond valence thus represents a simple-to-compute property that unifies understanding of exchange sensitivity for catalytic properties and spin-state ordering in TM complexes. Close agreement of the resulting per-metal–organic-bond sensitivity estimates, together with failure of alternative descriptors demonstrates the utility of the bond valence as a robust descriptor of how differences in metal–ligand delocalization produce differing relative energetics with exchange tuning. Our unified description explains the overall effect of exact exchange tuning on the paradigmatic two-state FeO+/CH4 reaction that combines challenges of spin-state and reactivity predictions. This new descriptor-sensitivity relationship provides a path to quantifying how predictions in transition-metal complex screening are sensitive to the method used.},

Although paths to correction of energetic delocalization error are well-established, the impact of these corrections on the electron density is less well-studied. Here, we compare the effect on density delocalization of DFT+U (i.e., semilocal DFT augmented with a Hubbard U correction), global hybrid tuning, and range-separated hybrid tuning on a diverse test set of 32 transition metal complexes and observe the three methods to have qualitatively equivalent effects on the ground state density. Regardless of valence orbital diffuseness (i.e., from 2p to 5p), ligand electronegativity (i.e., from Al to O), basis set (i.e., plane wave versus localized basis set), metal (i.e., Ti, Fe, Ni), and spin state, or tuning method, we consistently observe substantial charge loss at the metal and gain at ligand atoms (∼0.3–0.5 e or more). This charge loss at the metal is preferentially from the minority spin, leading to increasing magnetic moment as well. Using accurate wave function theory references, we observe that a minimum error in partial charges and magnetic moments occurs at higher tuning parameters than typically employed to eliminate energetic delocalization error. These observations motivate the need to develop multifaceted approximate-DFT error correction approaches that separately treat density delocalization and energetic errors to recover both correct density and orbital energy-derived properties.},

We design monodentate and bidentate ligands from scratch for the construction of mononuclear, octahedral transition metal complexes with up to 13 heavy atoms (i.e., metal, C, N, O, P, or S). From \textgreater11 000 theoretical ligands, we develop a heuristic score for ranking a chemically feasible 2500 ligand subset, only 71 of which were previously included in common organic molecule databases. We characterize the top 20% of scored ligands with density functional theory (DFT) in an octahedral homoleptic ligand database (OHLDB). The OHLDB contains i) the geometry optimized structures of 1250 homoleptic octahedral complexes obtained from the enumerated pool of ligands and an open-shell transition metal (M(II)/M(III), M = Cr, Mn, Fe, or Co) and ii) the resulting high-spin/low-spin adiabatic electronic energy differences (ΔEH–L) obtained with hybrid DFT. Over the OHLDB, we observe structure–property (i.e., ΔEH–L) relationships different from those expected on the basis of ligand field arguments or from our prior data sets.

Here, we compute mechanistically relevant electronic and energetic properties for 19 mononuclear Ru transition-metal complexes (TMCs) from three experimental water oxidation catalysis studies.

We use this approach to rationalize differences in activity with different experimental conditions, and we qualitatively analyze the source of distinct behavior for different electronic states in the other four catalysts.

By addressing the scarcity of data in promising regions of chemical space for challenging targets such as open-shell transition-metal complexes, general representations and transferable ML models that leverage known relationships in existing data will accelerate discovery. Over a large set (∼1000) of isovalent transition-metal complexes, we quantify evident relationships for different properties (i.e., spin-splitting and ligand dissociation) between rows of the Periodic Table (i.e., 3d/4d metals and 2p/3p ligands). We demonstrate an extension to the graph-based revised autocorrelation (RAC) representation (i.e., eRAC) that incorporates the group number alongside the nuclear charge heuristic that otherwise overestimates dissimilarity of isovalent complexes. To address the common challenge of discovery in a new space where data are limited, we introduce a transfer learning approach in which we seed models trained on a large amount of data from one row of the Periodic Table with a small number of data points from the additional row. We demonstrate the synergistic value of the eRACs alongside this transfer learning strategy to consistently improve model performance. Analysis of these models highlights how the approach succeeds by reordering the distances between complexes to be more consistent with the Periodic Table, a property we expect to be broadly useful for other material domains.},

 abstract = {Prediction of spin-state ordering in transition metal complexes is essential for understanding catalytic activity and designing functional materials. Semilocal approximations in density functional theory, such as the generalized-gradient approximation (GGA), suffer from several errors including delocalization error that give rise to systematic bias for more covalently bound low-spin electronic states. Incorporation of exact exchange is known to counteract this bias, instead favoring high-spin states, in a manner that has recently been identified to be strongly ligand-field dependent. In this work, we introduce a tuning strategy to identify the effect of incorporating the Laplacian of the density (i.e., a meta-GGA) in exchange on spin-state ordering. We employ a diverse test set of M(II) and M(III) first-row transition metal ions from Ti to Cu as well as octahedral complexes of these ions with ligands of increasing field strength (i.e., H2O, NH3, and CO). We show that the sensitivity of spin-state ordering to meta-GGA exchange is highly ligand-field dependent, stabilizing high-spin states in strong-field (i.e., CO) cases and stabilizing low-spin states in weak-field (i.e., H2O, NH3, and isolated ions) cases. This diverging behavior leads to generally improved treatment of isolated ions and strong field complexes over a standard GGA but worsened treatment for the hexa-aqua or hexa-ammine complexes. These observations highlight the sensitivity of functional performance to subtle changes in chemical bonding.},

Based on the observation that the range of parameters spanned by the most widely employed functionals is relatively narrow, we compute electronic structure property and spin-state orderings across a relatively broad range of Hartree-Fock exchange (0%-50%) ratios. For the entire range considered, we consistently observe linear relationships between spin-state ordering that differ only based on the element of the direct ligand and thus may be broadly employed as measures of functional sensitivity in predictions of organometallic compounds. The role Hartree-Fock exchange in hybrid functionals is often assumed to play is to correct self-interaction error-driven electron delocalization (e.g., from transition metal centers to neighboring ligands). Surprisingly, we instead observe that increasing Hartree-Fock exchange reduces charge on iron centers, corresponding to effective delocalization of charge to ligands, thus challenging notions of the role of Hartree-Fock exchange in shifting predictions of spin-state ordering.},

We explore a compound space of over 5600 candidate materials derived from eight metal/oxidation state combinations and a 32-ligand pool. We introduce a strategy for error-aware ML-driven discovery by limiting how far the GA travels away from the nearest ANN training points while maximizing property (i.e., spin-splitting) fitness, leading to discovery of 80% of the leads from full chemical space enumeration. Over a 51-complex subset, average unsigned errors (4.5 kcal/mol) are close to the ANN’s baseline 3 kcal/mol error. By obtaining leads from the trained ANN within seconds rather than days from a DFT-driven GA, this strategy demonstrates the power of ML for accelerating inorganic material discovery.},

 abstract = {The accelerated discovery of materials for real world applications requires the achievement of multiple design objectives. The multidimensional nature of the search necessitates exploration of multimillion compound libraries over which even density functional theory (DFT) screening is intractable. Machine learning (e.g., artificial neural network, ANN, or Gaussian process, GP) models for this task are limited by training data availability and predictive uncertainty quantification (UQ). We overcome such limitations by using efficient global optimization (EGO) with the multidimensional expected improvement (EI) criterion. EGO balances exploitation of a trained model with acquisition of new DFT data at the Pareto front, the region of chemical space that contains the optimal trade-off between multiple design criteria. We demonstrate this approach for the simultaneous optimization of redox potential and solubility in candidate M(II)/M(III) redox couples for redox flow batteries from a space of 2.8 M transition metal complexes designed for stability in practical redox flow battery (RFB) applications. We show that a multitask ANN with latent-distance-based UQ surpasses the generalization performance of a GP in this space. With this approach, ANN prediction and EI scoring of the full space are achieved in minutes. Starting from ca. 100 representative points, EGO improves both properties by over 3 standard deviations in only five generations. Analysis of lookahead errors confirms rapid ANN model improvement during the EGO process, achieving suitable accuracy for predictive design in the space of transition metal complexes. The ANN-driven EI approach achieves at least 500-fold acceleration over random search, identifying a Pareto-optimal design in around 5 weeks instead of 50 years.},

First-principles simulations are increasingly accurate and applicable to large systems with the speed needed for high-throughput computational screening. Despite these strides, the combinatorial challenges associated with the vastness of chemical space mean that more than just fast and accurate computational tools are needed for accelerated chemical discovery. In transition-metal chemistry and catalysis, unique challenges arise. The variable spin, oxidation state, and coordination environments favored by elements with well-localized d or f electrons provide great opportunity for tailoring properties in catalytic or functional (e.g., magnetic) materials but also add layers of uncertainty to any design strategy. We outline five key mandates for realizing computationally driven accelerated discovery in inorganic chemistry: (i) fully automated simulation of new compounds, (ii) knowledge of prediction sensitivity or accuracy, (iii) faster-than-fast property prediction methods, (iv) maps for rapid chemical space traversal, and (v) a means to reveal design rules on the kilocompound scale. Through case studies in open-shell transition-metal chemistry, we describe how advances in methodology and software in each of these areas bring about new chemical insights. We conclude with our outlook on the next steps in this process toward realizing fully autonomous discovery in inorganic chemistry using computational chemistry.},

Although the computational materials science community has benefited from open source tools for the rapid structure generation, calculation, and analysis of crystalline inorganic materials, software and strategies to address the unique challenges of inorganic complex discovery have not been as widely available. We present a unified view of our recent developments in the open source molSimplify code for inorganic discovery. Building on our previous efforts in the automated generation of highly accurate inorganic molecular structures, first-principles simulation, and property analysis to accelerate high-throughput screening, we have recently incorporated a neural network that both improves structure generation and predicts electronic properties prior to first-principles calculation. We also provide an overview of how multimillion molecule organic libraries can be leveraged for inorganic discovery alongside cheminformatics concepts of molecular diversity in order to efficiently traverse chemical space. We demonstrate all of these tools on the discovery of design rules for octahedral Fe(II/III) redox couples with nitrogen ligands. Over a search of only approximately 40 new molecules, we obtain redox potentials relative to the Fc/Fc+ couple ranging from −1 to 4.5 V in aqueous solution. Our new automated correlation analysis reveals heteroatom identity and the degree of structural branching to be key ligand descriptors in determining redox potential.

@article{janet_navigating_2021,
 abstract = {ConspectusThe variability of chemical bonding in open-shell transition-metal complexes not only motivates their study as functional materials and catalysts but also challenges conventional computational modeling tools. Here, tailoring ligand chemistry can alter preferred spin or oxidation states as well as electronic structure properties and reactivity, creating vast regions of chemical space to explore when designing new materials atom by atom. Although first-principles density functional theory (DFT) remains the workhorse of computational chemistry in mechanism deduction and property prediction, it is of limited use here. DFT is both far too computationally costly for widespread exploration of transition-metal chemical space and also prone to inaccuracies that limit its predictive performance for localized d electrons in transition-metal complexes. These challenges starkly contrast with the well-trodden regions of small-organic-molecule chemical space, where the analytical forms of molecular mechanics force fields and semiempirical theories have for decades accelerated the discovery of new molecules, accurate DFT functional performance has been demonstrated, and gold-standard methods from correlated wavefunction theory can predict experimental results to chemical accuracy.The combined promise of transition-metal chemical space exploration and lack of established tools has mandated a distinct approach. In this Account, we outline the path we charted in exploration of transition-metal chemical space starting from the first machine learning (ML) models (i.e., artificial neural network and kernel ridge regression) and representations for the prediction of open-shell transition-metal complex properties. The distinct importance of the immediate coordination environment of the metal center as well as the lack of low-level methods to accurately predict structural properties in this coordination environment first motivated and then benefited from these ML models and representations. Once developed, the recipe for prediction of geometric, spin state, and redox potential properties was straightforwardly extended to a diverse range of other properties, including in catalysis, computational “feasibility”, and the gas separation properties of periodic metal–organic frameworks. Interpretation of selected features most important for model prediction revealed new ways to encapsulate design rules and confirmed that models were robustly mapping essential structure–property relationships. Encountering the special challenge of ensuring that good model performance could generalize to new discovery targets motivated investigation of how to best carry out model uncertainty quantification. Distance-based approaches, whether in model latent space or in carefully engineered feature space, provided intuitive measures of the domain of applicability. With all of these pieces together, ML can be harnessed as an engine to tackle the large-scale exploration of transition-metal chemical space needed to satisfy multiple objectives using efficient global optimization methods. In practical terms, bringing these artificial intelligence tools to bear on the problems of transition-metal chemical space exploration has resulted in ML-model assessments of large, multimillion compound spaces in minutes and validated new design leads in weeks instead of decades.},

 abstract = {High-throughput computational screening has emerged as a critical component of materials discovery. Direct density functional theory (DFT) simulation of inorganic materials and molecular transition metal complexes is often used to describe subtle trends in inorganic bonding and spin-state ordering, but these calculations are computationally costly and properties are sensitive to the exchange–correlation functional employed. To begin to overcome these challenges, we trained artificial neural networks (ANNs) to predict quantum-mechanically-derived properties, including spin-state ordering, sensitivity to Hartree–Fock exchange, and spin-state specific bond lengths in transition metal complexes. Our ANN is trained on a small set of inorganic-chemistry-appropriate empirical inputs that are both maximally transferable and do not require precise three-dimensional structural information for prediction. Using these descriptors, our ANN predicts spin-state splittings of single-site transition metal complexes (i.e., Cr–Ni) at arbitrary amounts of Hartree–Fock exchange to within 3 kcal mol−1 accuracy of DFT calculations. Our exchange-sensitivity ANN enables improved predictions on a diverse test set of experimentally-characterized transition metal complexes by extrapolation from semi-local DFT to hybrid DFT. The ANN also outperforms other machine learning models (i.e., support vector regression and kernel ridge regression), demonstrating particularly improved performance in transferability, as measured by prediction errors on the diverse test set. We establish the value of new uncertainty quantification tools to estimate ANN prediction uncertainty in computational chemistry, and we provide additional heuristics for identification of when a compound of interest is likely to be poorly predicted by the ANN. The ANNs developed in this work provide a strategy for screening transition metal complexes both with direct ANN prediction and with improved structure generation for validation with first principles simulation.},

Established uncertainty metrics for neural network models are either costly to obtain (e.g., ensemble models) or rely on feature engineering (e.g., feature space distances), and each has limitations in estimating prediction errors for chemical space exploration. We introduce the distance to available data in the latent space of a neural network ML model as a low-cost, quantitative uncertainty metric that works for both inorganic and organic chemistry. The calibrated performance of this approach exceeds widely used uncertainty metrics and is readily applied to models of increasing complexity at no additional cost.

For transition metal chemistry where accurate calculations are computationally costly and available training data sets are small, the molecular representation becomes a critical ingredient in ML model predictive accuracy. We introduce a series of revised autocorrelation functions (RACs) that encode relationships of the heuristic atomic properties (e.g., size, connectivity, and electronegativity) on a molecular graph. We alter the starting point, scope, and nature of the quantities evaluated in standard ACs to make these RACs amenable to inorganic chemistry. On an organic molecule set, we first demonstrate superior standard AC performance to other presently available topological descriptors for ML model training, with mean unsigned errors (MUEs) for atomization energies on set-aside test molecules as low as 6 kcal/mol. For inorganic chemistry, our RACs yield 1 kcal/mol ML MUEs on set-aside test molecules in spin-state splitting in comparison to 15–20× higher errors for feature sets that encode whole-molecule structural information. Systematic feature selection methods including univariate filtering, recursive feature elimination, and direct optimization (e.g., random forest and LASSO) are compared. Random-forest- or LASSO-selected subsets 4–5× smaller than the full RAC set produce sub- to 1 kcal/mol spin-splitting MUEs, with good transferability to metal–ligand bond length prediction (0.004–5 Å MUE) and redox potential on a smaller data set (0.2–0.3 eV MUE). Evaluation of feature selection results across property sets reveals the relative importance of local, electronic descriptors (e.g., electronegativity, atomic number) in spin-splitting and distal, steric effects in redox potential and bond lengths.},

 abstract = {Doped graphitic single-atom catalysts (SACs) with isolated iron sites have similarities to natural enzymes and molecular biomimetics that can convert methane to methanol via a radical rebound mechanism with high-valent Fe(IV) O intermediates. To understand the relationship of SACs to these homogeneous analogues, we use range-separated hybrid density functional theory (DFT) to compare the energetics and structure of the direct metal-coordinating environment in the presence of 2p (i.e., N or O) and 3p (i.e., P or S) dopants and with increasing finite graphene model flake size to mimic differences in local rigidity. While metal–ligand bond lengths in SACs are significantly shorter than those in transition-metal complexes, they remain longer than SAC mimic macrocyclic complexes. In SACs or the macrocyclic complexes, this compressed metal–ligand environment induces metal distortion out of the plane, especially when reactive species are bound to iron. As a result of this modified metal-coordination environment, we observe SACs to simultaneously favor the formation of the metal–oxo while also allowing for methanol release. This reactivity is different from what has been observed for large sets of square planar model homogeneous catalysts. Overall, our calculations recommend broader consideration of dopants (e.g., P or S) and processing conditions that allow for local distortion around the metal site in graphitic SACs.},

Until recently only one route was known for isonitrile biosynthesis, a condensation reaction that brings together a nitrogen atom of l-Trp/l-Tyr with a carbon atom from ribulose-5-phosphate. With the discovery of ScoE, a mononuclear Fe(II) α-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase from Streptomyces coeruleorubidus, a second route was identified. ScoE forms isonitrile from a glycine adduct, with both the nitrogen and carbon atoms coming from the same glycyl moiety. This reaction is part of the nonribosomal biosynthetic pathway of isonitrile lipopeptides. Here, we present structural, biochemical, and computational investigations of the mechanism of isonitrile formation by ScoE, an unprecedented reaction in the mononuclear Fe(II) α-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase superfamily. The stoichiometry of this enzymatic reaction is measured, and multiple high-resolution (1.45–1.96 Å resolution) crystal structures of Fe(II)-bound ScoE are presented, providing insight into the binding of substrate, (R)-3-((carboxylmethyl)amino)butanoic acid (CABA), cosubstrate α-ketoglutarate, and an Fe(IV)=O mimic oxovanadium. Comparison to a previously published crystal structure of ScoE suggests that ScoE has an “inducible” α-ketoglutarate binding site, in which two residues arginine-157 and histidine-299 move by approximately 10 Å from the surface of the protein into the active site to create a transient α-ketoglutarate binding pocket. Together, data from structural analyses, site-directed mutagenesis, and computation provide insight into the mode of α-ketoglutarate binding, the mechanism of isonitrile formation, and how the structure of ScoE has been adapted to perform this unusual chemical reaction.},

 abstract = {Hybrid quantum mechanical-molecular mechanical (QM/MM) simulations are widely used in enzyme simulation. Over ten convergence studies of QM/MM methods have revealed over the past several years that key energetic and structural properties approach asymptotic limits with only very large (ca. 500–1000 atom) QM regions. This slow convergence has been observed to be due in part to significant charge transfer between the core active site and the surrounding protein environment, which cannot be addressed by improvement of MM force fields or the embedding method employed within QM/MM. Given this slow convergence, it becomes essential to identify strategies for the most atom-economical determination of optimal QM regions and to gain insight into the crucial interactions captured only in large QM regions. Here, we extend and develop two methods for quantitative determination of QM regions. First, in the charge shift analysis (CSA) method, we probe the reorganization of electron density when core active site residues are removed completely, as determined by large-QM region QM/MM calculations. Second, we introduce the highly parallelizable Fukui shift analysis (FSA), which identifies how core/substrate frontier states are altered by the presence of an additional QM residue in smaller initial QM regions. We demonstrate that the FSA and CSA approaches are complementary and consistent on three test case enzymes: catechol O-methyltransferase, cytochrome P450cam, and hen eggwhite lysozyme. We also introduce validation strategies and test the sensitivities of the two methods to geometric structure, basis set size, and electronic structure methodology. Both methods represent promising approaches for the systematic, unbiased determination of quantum mechanical effects in enzymes and large systems that necessitate multiscale modeling.},

 abstract = {Plants contain rapidly evolving specialized metabolic enzymes to support the synthesis of a myriad of functionally diverse natural products. In the case of coumarin biosynthesis, a BAHD acyltransferase-family enzyme COSY was recently discovered in Arabidopsis that catalyzes coumarin formation from o-hydroxylated trans-hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA substrates. COSY is the first and only BAHD enzyme known to date that catalyzes an intramolecular acyl transfer reaction. Here we combine structural, biochemical, and computational approaches to investigate the mechanistic basis for the unique coumarin synthase activity of COSY. Comparative analyses of crystal structures of Arabidopsis thaliana COSY relative to other BAHD proteins reveal that COSY possesses an unconventional active-site configuration adapted to its specialized activity. Through deuterium exchange experiments, we discover a unique proton exchange mechanism at the β-carbon of the o-hydroxylated trans-hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA substrates during the catalytic cycle of COSY. Mutagenesis studies and quantum mechanical cluster modeling further support that this mechanism is key to COSY’s ability to lower the activation energy of the trans-to-cis isomerization of the hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA substrates, a critical rate-limiting step leading to courmarin production. This study unveils the emergence of an unconventional catalytic mechanism mediated by a BAHD-family enzyme, and sheds light on the potential evolutionary origin of COSY and its recruitment to the evolutionarily new coumarin biosynthetic pathway in eudicots.},

 abstract = {Indium phosphide quantum dots (QDs) represent promising replacements for more toxic QDs, but InP QD production lags behind other QD materials due to limited understanding of how to tune InP QD growth. We carry out a first-principles, computational screen of the tuning of In carboxylate precursor chemistry to alter the kinetics of elementary steps in InP QD growth. We employ a large database normally used for discovery of therapeutic drug-like molecules to discover design rules for these inorganic complexes while maintaining realism (i.e., stable, synthetically accessible substituents) and providing diversity in a 210-molecule test set. We show the In–O bond cleavage energy, which is tuned through ligand functionalization, to be a useful proxy for In–P bond formation energetics in InP QD synthesis. Energy decomposition analysis on a 32-molecule subset reveals that lower activation energies correlate to later transition states, due to stabilization from greater In–P bond formation and more favorable reaction energetics. Our simulations suggest that altering ligand nucleophilicity tunes the reaction barrier over a 10 kcal/mol range, providing the conjugate acid’s pKa as an experimental handle to lead to better control of growth conditions and to improve synthesized InP QD quality. Importantly, these trends hold regardless of phosphorus precursor chemistries and in the longer chain length ligands typically used in synthesis.},

 abstract = {We present a detailed study of nearly 70 Zn molecular catalysts for CO2 hydration from four diverse ligand classes ranging from well-studied carbonic anhydrase mimics (e.g., cyclen) to new structures we obtain by leveraging diverse hits from large organic libraries. Using microkinetic analysis and establishing linear free energy relationships, we confirm that turnover is sensitive to the relative thermodynamic stability of reactive hydroxyl and bound bicarbonate moieties. We observe a wide range of thermodynamic stabilities for these intermediates, showing up to 6 kcal/mol improvement over well-studied cyclen catalysts. We observe a good correlation between the pKa of the Zn–OH2 moiety and the resulting relative stability of hydroxyl moieties over bicarbonate, which may be rationalized by the dominant effect of the difference in higher Zn−OH bond order in comparison to weaker bonding in bicarbonate and water. A direct relationship is identified between isolated organic ligand pKa and the pKa of a bound water molecule on the catalyst. Thus, organic ligand pKa, which is intuitive, easy to compute or tabulate, and much less sensitive to electronic structure method choice than whole-catalyst properties, is a good quantitative descriptor for predicting the effect of through-bond electronic effects on relative CO2 hydration energetics. We expect this to be applicable to other reactions where is it essential to stabilize turnover-determining hydroxyl species with respect to more weakly bound moieties. Finally, we note exceptions for rigid ligands (e.g., porphyrins) that are observed to preferentially stabilize hydroxyl over bicarbonate without reducing pKa values as substantially. We expect the strategy outlined here, to (i) curate diverse ligands from large organic libraries and (ii) identify when ligand-only properties can determine catalyst energetics, to be broadly useful for both experimental and computational catalyst design.},

 abstract = {Based on high-level ab initio calculations, we predict the existence of a strong 4Σ+–4Σ+ optical transition (dav=1.6D) near 328nm (T00=30460cm-1), analogous to the B2Σ+–X2Σ+ violet system, (dav=1.7D) in the near-ultraviolet spectrum of CN. The lower state of the predicted transition is the lowest-lying state of quartet multiplicity and has been observed previously through its perturbations of the B state. The predicted transition will enable determination of the equilibrium properties of the metastable lowest quartet state of CN. The lowest energy metastable sextet state of CN is also calculated to be quasi-bound (re=1.76Å,ωe=365cm-1), and a 6Σ+–6Σ+ transition, analogous to those for the doublet and quartet multiplicities, is predicted (dav=2.2D). Investigation of the isoelectronic BO, C2-, and N2+ molecules reveals that differences in 2s22px and 2s12px+1 atomic energies play the key role in determining the magnitude of the 5σ(2p)←4σ(2s)-derived Σ+–Σ+ transition energies for the different multiplicities. Furthermore, the strong stabilization of 2s22px character with respect to 2s12px+1 in BO and N2+ leads to strongly bound lowest 6Σ+states with binding energies as high as 2.0eV. We believe that these newly predicted sextet states could be identified through their perturbations of quartet states of the relevant molecules.},

The efficiency of the GPU-based quantum chemistry algorithms implemented in our TeraChem program enables us to carry out systematic optimization of ab initio protein structures, which we compare against experimental and molecular mechanics force field references. We show that the quality of the ab initio optimized structures, as judged by conventional protein health metrics, increases with increasing basis set size. On the other hand, there is little evidence for a significant improvement of predicted structures using density functional theory as compared to Hartree–Fock methods. Although occasional pathologies of minimal basis sets are observed, these are easily alleviated with even the smallest double-ζ basis sets.},

 abstract = {We introduce an improvement to the Hubbard U augmented density functional approach known as DFT+U that incorporates variations in the value of self-consistently calculated, linear-response U with changes in geometry. This approach overcomes the one major shortcoming of previous DFT+U studies, i.e., the use of an averaged Hubbard U when comparing energies for different points along a potential energy surface is no longer required. While DFT+U is quite successful at providing accurate descriptions of localized electrons (e.g., d or f) by correcting self-interaction errors of standard exchange correlation functionals, we show several diatomic molecule examples where this position-dependent DFT+U(R) provides a significant two- to four-fold improvement over DFT+U predictions, when compared to accurate correlated quantum chemistry and experimental references. DFT+U(R) reduces errors in binding energies, frequencies, and equilibrium bond lengths by applying the linear-response, position-dependent U(R) at each configuration considered. This extension is most relevant where variations in U are large across the points being compared, as is the case with covalent diatomic molecules such as transition-metal oxides. We thus provide a tool for deciding whether a standard DFT+U approach is sufficient by determining the strength of the dependence of U on changes in coordinates. We also apply this approach to larger systems with greater degrees of freedom and demonstrate how DFT+U(R) may be applied automatically in relaxations, transition-state finding methods, and dynamics.},

 abstract = {Recent algorithmic and hardware advances have enabled the application of electronic structure methods to the study of large-scale systems such as proteins with O(103) atoms. Most such methods benefit greatly from the use of reduced basis sets to further enhance their speed, but truly minimal basis sets are well-known to suffer from incompleteness error that gives rise to incorrect descriptions of chemical bonding, preventing minimal basis set use in production calculations. We present a strategy for improving these well-known shortcomings in minimal basis sets by selectively tuning the energetics and bonding of nitrogen and oxygen atoms within proteins and small molecules to reproduce polarized double-ζ basis set geometries at minimal basis set cost. We borrow the well-known +U correction from the density functional theory community normally employed for self-interaction errors and demonstrate its power in the context of correcting basis set incompleteness within a formally self-interaction-free Hartree–Fock framework. We tune the Hubbard U parameters for nitrogen and oxygen atoms on small-molecule tautomers (e.g., cytosine), demonstrate the applicability of the approach on a number of amide-containing molecules (e.g., formamide, alanine tripeptide), and test our strategy on a 10 protein test set where anomalous proton transfer events are reduced by 90% from RHF/STO-3G to RHF/STO-3G+U, bringing the latter into quantitative agreement with RHF/6-31G* results. Although developed with the study of biological molecules in mind, this empirically tuned U approach shows promise as an alternative strategy for correction of basis set incompleteness errors.},

Carbon sequestration via hydration is used as the model reaction, and three- and four-coordinate sp2 or sp3 nitrogen-ligand motifs are considered for ZnII metals. The comparison of binding, activation and product release energies over a large range of interaction distances and angles suggests that four-coordinate short ZnII—Nsp3 bond distances favor a rapid turnover for CO2 hydration. This design strategy is then confirmed by computationally characterizing the reactivity of a known mimic over a range of metal–nitrogen bond lengths. A search of existing catalysts in a chemical database reveals structures that match the target geometry from model calculations, and subsequent calculations have identified these structures as potentially effective for CO2 hydration and sequestration.},

 abstract = {We present here a computational study of reactions at a model complex of the SyrB2 enzyme active site. SyrB2, which chlorinates l-threonine in the syringomycin biosynthetic pathway, belongs to a recently discovered class of α-ketoglutarate (αKG), non-heme Fe(II)-dependent halogenases that share many structural and chemical similarities with hydroxylases. Namely, halogenases and hydroxylases alike decarboxylate the αKG co-substrate, facilitating formation of a high-energy ferryl-oxo intermediate that abstracts a hydrogen from the reactant complex. The reaction mechanisms differ at this point, and mutation of active site residues (Asp for the hydroxylase to Ala or Ala to Asp/Glu for halogenase) fails to reproduce hydroxylating activity in SyrB2 or halogenating activity in similar hydroxylases. Using a density functional theory approach with a recently implemented Hubbard U correction for accurate treatment of transition-metal chemistry, we explore probable reaction pathways and mechanisms via a model complex consisting of only the iron center and its direct ligands. We show that the first step, αKG decarboxylation, is barrierless and exothermic, but the subsequent hydrogen abstraction step has an energetic barrier consistent with that accessible under biological conditions. In the model complex we use, radical chlorination is barrierless and exothermic, whereas the analogous hydroxylation is found to have a small energetic barrier. The hydrogen abstraction and radical chlorination steps are strongly coupled: the barrier for the hydrogen abstraction step is reduced when carried out concomitantly with the exothermic chlorination step. Our work suggests that the lack of chlorination in mutant hydroxylases is most likely due to poor binding of chlorine in the active site, whereas mutant halogenases do not hydroxylate for energetic reasons. Although secondary shell residues undoubtedly modulate the overall reactivity and binding of relevant substrates, we show that a small model compound consisting exclusively of the direct ligands to the metal can help explain reactivity heretofore not yet understood in the halogenase SyrB2.},

 abstract = {Hybrid quantum mechanical–molecular mechanical (QM/MM) simulations are widely used in studies of enzymatic catalysis. Until recently, it has been cost prohibitive to determine the asymptotic limit of key energetic and structural properties with respect to increasingly large QM regions. Leveraging recent advances in electronic structure efficiency and accuracy, we investigate catalytic properties in catechol O-methyltransferase, a prototypical methyltransferase critical to human health. Using QM regions ranging in size from reactants-only (64 atoms) to nearly one-third of the entire protein (940 atoms), we show that properties such as the activation energy approach within chemical accuracy of the large-QM asymptotic limits rather slowly, requiring approximately 500–600 atoms if the QM residues are chosen simply by distance from the substrate. This slow approach to asymptotic limit is due to charge transfer from protein residues to the reacting substrates. Our large QM/MM calculations enable identification of charge separation for fragments in the transition state as a key component of enzymatic methyl transfer rate enhancement. We introduce charge shift analysis that reveals the minimum number of protein residues (approximately 11–16 residues or 200–300 atoms for COMT) needed for quantitative agreement with large-QM simulations. The identified residues are not those that would be typically selected using criteria such as chemical intuition or proximity. These results provide a recipe for a more careful determination of QM region sizes in future QM/MM studies of enzymes.},

In particular, the first solvation shell water molecules of calcium are able to form acceptor hydrogen bonds, and this results in an enhancement of a post-edge peak near 540 eV. The absence of acceptor hydrogen bonds for magnesium first shell water molecules provides an explanation for the experimental and theoretical observation of a lack of enhancement at the post-main-edge peak. For the sodium monovalent cation we find that the broad tilt angle distribution results in a broadening of postedge features, despite populations in donor-and-acceptor configurations consistent with calcium. We also present the reaveraged spectra of the MgCl2, CaCl2, and NaCl solutions and show that trends apparent with increasing concentration (0.5, 2.0, 4.0 M) are consistent with experiment. Finally, we examine more closely both the effect that cation coordination number has on the hydrogen-bonding network and the relative perturbation strength of the cations on lone pair oxygen orbitals.},

 abstract = {As machine learning (ML) has matured, it has opened a new frontier in theoretical and computational chemistry by offering the promise of simultaneous paradigm shifts in accuracy and efficiency. Nowhere is this advance more needed, but also more challenging to achieve, than in the discovery of open-shell transition metal complexes. Here, localized d or f electrons exhibit variable bonding that is challenging to capture even with the most computationally demanding methods. Thus, despite great promise, clear obstacles remain in constructing ML models that can supplement or even replace explicit electronic structure calculations. In this article, I outline the recent advances in building ML models in transition metal chemistry, including the ability to approach sub-kcal/mol accuracy on a range of properties with tailored representations, to discover and enumerate complexes in large chemical spaces, and to reveal opportunities for design through analysis of feature importance. I discuss unique considerations that have been essential to enabling ML in open-shell transition metal chemistry, including (a) the relationship of data set size/diversity, model complexity, and representation choice, (b) the importance of quantitative assessments of both theory and model domain of applicability, and (c) the need to enable autonomous generation of reliable, large data sets both for ML model training and in active learning or discovery contexts. Finally, I summarize the next steps toward making ML a mainstream tool in the accelerated discovery of transition metal complexes.

This theoretical and computational background is followed by a discussion of the basics of mechanochemical experiments, including both approaches and the nature of molecules studied. This background then enables the readers to review some fundamental, representative cases of how computation has provided insight into mechanochemical bond cleavage. The chapter further provides a summary of practical challenges for the novice wishing to carry out mechanochemical simulation. While relevant for all fields of simulation, a particularly pertinent concern in the first-principles modeling of mechanochemical bond cleavage is the balance of computational cost and accuracy.

@article{kulik_perspective_2015,
 abstract = {Many people in the materials science and solid-state community are familiar with the acronym “DFT+U.” For those less familiar, this technique uses ideas from model Hamiltonians that permit the description of both metals and insulators to address problems of electron over-delocalization in practical implementations of density functional theory (DFT). Exchange-correlation functionals in DFT are often described as belonging to a hierarchical “Jacob’s ladder” of increasing accuracy in moving from local to non-local descriptions of exchange and correlation. DFT+U is not on this “ladder” but rather acts as an “elevator” because it systematically tunes relative energetics, typically on a localized subshell (e.g., d or f electrons), regardless of the underlying functional employed. However, this tuning is based on a metric of the local electron density of the subshells being addressed, thus necessitating physical or chemical or intuition about the system of interest. I will provide a brief overview of the history of how DFT+U came to be starting from the origin of the Hubbard and Anderson model Hamiltonians. This history lesson is necessary because it permits us to make the connections between the “Hubbard U” and fundamental outstanding challenges in electronic structure theory, and it helps to explain why this method is so widely applied to transition-metal oxides and organometallic complexes alike.},

We found that the ions preferentially reside near the interface between the nanotube and the liquid. Upon confinement, the XAS signal of water molecules surrounding Na+ exhibits enhanced pre-edge and reduced post-edge features with respect to that of pure water, at variance with the solvation shell of Na+ in bulk water. Conversely, the first solvation shell of confined Cl– has a main-edge intensity comparable to that of bulk solvated Cl–, likely as a result of a high number of acceptor hydrogen bonds in the first solvation shell. Confined nonsolvating water molecules exhibit bulk-like or water-monomer-like properties, depending on whether they belong to core or interfacial layers, respectively.},

@article{kulik_self-consistent_2008,
 abstract = {We present a detailed analysis of the addition-elimination reaction pathways for the gas-phase conversion of molecular hydrogen and methane on FeO+ to water and methanol, respectively, using first-principles calculations. These two reactions represent paradigmatic, challenging test cases for electronic structure approaches to transition-metal catalysis. We compare here density-functional approaches against state-of-the-art coupled-cluster and multireference quantum chemistry approaches. The quantum chemical approaches are found to be in close agreement between themselves as well as with the available experimental evidence. For the density-functional calculations, we employ a recently introduced ab initio, self-consistent Hubbard-like correction, coupled here with a generalized-gradient approximation (GGA) for the exchange-correlation functional. We find that our formulation provides a remarkable improvement in the description of the electronic structure, hybridization, and multiplet splittings for all calculated stationary points along these reaction pathways. The Hubbard term, which is not a fitting parameter and, in principle, can augment any exchange-correlation functional, brings the density-functional theory results in close agreement with the reference calculations. In particular, thermochemical errors as large as 1.4 eV in the exit channels with the GGA functional are reduced by an order of magnitude, to less than 0.1 eV on average; additionally, close agreement with the correlated-electron reference calculations and experiments are achieved for intermediate spin splittings and structures, reaction exothermicity, and spin crossovers. The role that the Hubbard U term plays in improving both quantitative and qualitative descriptions of transition-metal chemistry is examined, and its strengths as well as possible weaknesses are discussed in detail.},

For the initial hydrogen abstraction step, the inherent flexibility of the phosphopantetheine molecule weakens the position dependence for both the native substrate (threonine for SyrB2) and alternative substrates. Over a 5 Å window of substrate positions, the tethered hydrogen abstraction step proceeds with nearly identical activation energies and donor-acceptor distances in the transition state. The propensity of a particular substrate toward halogenation or hydroxylation is found to depend strongly on the substrate placement following hydrogen abstraction, with deeper substrate delivery into the active (for native substrates) site favoring halogenation and shallower substrate delivery favoring hydroxylation.},

Diatomic molecules are building blocks of the key molecular bonding motifs in biological and inorganic catalytic systems, but, at the same time, their small size permits a thorough study by even the most computationally expensive quantum chemistry approaches. The results of several density-functional theory (DFT) approaches including hybrid, generalized-gradient, and generalized-gradient augmented with Hubbard U exchange-correlation functionals are presented. We compare these efficiently calculated DFT results with the highly accurate but computationally expensive post-Hartree–Fock approaches multireference configuration interaction (MRCI) and coupled cluster [CCSD(T)] as well as experimental values, where available. We show that by employing a Hubbard U approach, we systematically reduce average errors in state splittings and dissociation energies by a factor of 3. We are also able to reassign the ground state of four molecules improperly identified by hybrid or generalized-gradient approaches and provide correct assignment of all ground state symmetries as compared against experimental assignment and MRCI reference. By providing accuracy comparable to more expensive quantum chemistry approaches with the robust scaling of the generalized-gradient approximation, our DFT+U approach permits the study of very large scale systems with vastly improved results.},

We consider here three transition-metal dioxide molecules (MO2 where M = Mn, Fe, or Co), for which the equilibrium structural (e.g., bent or linear geometry) and electronic (e.g., spin or symmetry) properties have been challenging to assign both theoretically and experimentally. Augmenting a standard density-functional theory (DFT) approach with a Hubbard term (DFT+U) occasionally overlocalizes the 3d manifold, leading to an incorrect bond elongation and, in turn, poor equilibrium geometries for MO2 molecules, while preserving good spin-state splittings. Proper description of both geometry and energetics for these molecules is recovered; however, through either calculating DFT+U relaxations at fixed M–O bond lengths or by inclusion of an intersite interaction term V that favors M(3d)–O(2p) interactions. In this latter case, both U and V are calculated fully from first-principles and are not fitting parameters. Finally, we identify an approach that more accurately determines the Hubbard U over a coordinate in which the covalent character of bonding varies.},

Computational, first-principles modeling can provide essential insight into SAC mechanism and active site configuration, where the sub-nm-scale environment can challenge even the highest-resolution experimental spectroscopic techniques. Nevertheless, the very properties that make SACs attractive in catalysis, such as localized d electrons of the isolated transition metal center, make them challenging to study with conventional computational modeling using density functional theory (DFT). For example, Fe/N-doped graphitic SACs have exhibited spin-state dependent reactivity that remains poorly understood. However, spin-state ordering in DFT is very sensitive to the nature of the functional approximation chosen. In this work, we develop accurate benchmarks from correlated wavefunction theory (WFT) for relevant octahedral complexes. We use those benchmarks to evaluate optimal DFT functional choice for predicting spin state ordering in small octahedral complexes as well as models of pyridinic and pyrrolic nitrogen environments expected in larger SACs. Using these guidelines, we determine Fe/N-doped graphene SAC model properties and reactivity as well as their sensitivities to DFT functional choice. Finally, we conclude with broad recommendations for computational modeling of open-shell transition metal single-atom catalysts.},

Here, we first propose a GPU-based algorithm for the PCM conjugate gradient linear solver that greatly improves the performance for very large molecules. The overhead for PCM-related evaluations now consumes less than 15% of the total runtime for DFT calculations on large molecules. Second, we demonstrate that our algorithms tailored for ground state C-PCM are transferable to excited state properties. Using a single GPU, our method evaluates the analytic gradient of the linear response PCM time-dependent density functional theory energy up to 80× faster than a conventional central processing unit (CPU)-based implementation. In addition, our C-PCM algorithms are transferable to other methods that require electrostatic potential (ESP) evaluations. For example, we achieve speed-ups of up to 130× for restricted ESP-based atomic charge evaluations, when compared to CPU-based codes. We also summarize and compare the different PCM cavity discretization schemes used in some popular quantum chemistry packages as a reference for both users and developers.},

We show that for representative transition metal triatomics (MO2, where M = Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, or Ni) and related diatomics the incorporation of Hartree–Fock (HF) exchange in most cases improves the properties of the Born–Oppenheimer potential energy surface (PES) with respect to accurate experimental or CCSD(T) references. We rationalize this observation by noting reduced delocalization obtained with hybrid functionals (20–40% HF exchange), as evidenced by reduced hybridization of non-bonding orbitals and increases in metal partial charges. Although we show that the optimal exchange fraction is both property and system specific, incorporating HF exchange synergistically improves properties of density, structure, and energetics within a single PES characterized by moderately covalent bonding. The same improvement is not observed in the ordering of MO2 spin states, as good agreement of semi-local DFT spin state ordering is worsened by over-stabilization of higher spin states when HF exchange is added. More work is needed to understand minimal functional forms capable of improving multiple properties with respect to semi-local DFT descriptions of transition metal chemistry.},

However, its application in quantum mechanical calculations of large-scale biomolecular systems can be limited by computational expense of both the gas phase electronic structure and the solvation interaction.

Here, we extend the use of GPUs to accelerate electronic structure calculations including C-PCM solvation. Implementation on the GPU leads to significant acceleration of the generation of the required integrals for C-PCM. We further propose two strategies to improve the solution of the required linear equations: a dynamic convergence threshold and a randomized block-Jacobi preconditioner. These strategies are not specific to GPUs and are expected to be beneficial for both CPU and GPU implementations. We benchmark the performance of the new implementation using over 20 small proteins in solvent environment. Using a single GPU, our method evaluates the C-PCM related integrals and their derivatives more than 10× faster than that with a conventional CPU-based implementation. Our improvements to the linear solver provide a further 3× acceleration. The overall calculations including C-PCM solvation require, typically, 20–40% more effort than that for their gas phase counterparts for a moderate basis set and molecule surface discretization level. The relative cost of the C-PCM solvation correction decreases as the basis sets and/or cavity radii increase. Therefore, description of solvation with this model should be routine. We also discuss applications to the study of the conformational landscape of an amyloid fibril.},

@article{liu_rapid_2020,
 abstract = {Despite its widespread use in chemical discovery, approximate density functional theory (DFT) is poorly suited to many targets, such as those containing open-shell, 3d transition metals that can be expected to have strong multireference (MR) character. For discovery workflows to be predictive, we need automated, low-cost methods that can distinguish the regions of chemical space where DFT should be applied from those where it should not. We curate more than 4800 open-shell transition-metal complexes up to hundreds of atoms in size from prior high-throughput DFT studies and evaluate affordable, finite-temperature DFT fractional occupation number (FON)-based MR diagnostics. We show that intuitive measures of strong correlation (i.e., the HOMO–LUMO gap) are not predictive of MR character as judged by FON-based diagnostics. Analysis of independently trained machine learning (ML) models to predict HOMO–LUMO gaps and FON-based diagnostics reveals differences in the metal and ligand sensitivity of the two quantities. We use our trained ML models to rapidly evaluate MR character over a space of ∼187000 theoretical complexes, identifying large-scale trends in spin-state-dependent MR character and finding small HOMO–LUMO gap complexes while ensuring low MR character.},

We present a computational and theoretical screening approach to identify potential cleavage pathways and resulting fragments that are formed during depolymerization of lignin oligomers containing two to six monomers. We have developed a chemical discovery technique to identify the chemically relevant putative fragments in eight known polymeric linkage types of lignin. Obtaining these structures is a crucial precursor to the development of any further kinetic modeling. We have developed this approach by adapting steered molecular dynamics calculations under constant force and varying the points of applied force in the molecule to diversify the screening approach. Key observations include relationships between abundance and breaking frequency, the relative diversity of potential pathways for a given linkage, and the observation that readily cleaved bonds can destabilize adjacent bonds, causing subsequent automatic cleavage.},

@article{mar_depolymerization_2017,
 abstract = {Lignocellulosic biomass is an abundant, rich source of aromatic compounds, but direct utilization of raw lignin has been hampered by both the high heterogeneity and variability of linking bonds in this biopolymer. Ab initio steered molecular dynamics (AISMD) has emerged both as a fruitful direct computational screening approach to identify products that occur through mechanical depolymerization (i.e., in sonication or ball-milling) and as a sampling approach. By varying the direction of force and sampling over 750 AISMD trajectories, we identify numerous possible pathways through which lignin depolymerization may occur in pyrolysis or through catalytic depolymerization as well. Here, we present eight unique major depolymerization pathways discovered via AISMD for the recently characterized spirodienone lignin branching linkage that may comprise around 10% weight of all lignin in some softwoods. We extract representative trajectories from AISMD and carry out reaction pathway analysis to identify energetically favorable pathways for lignin depolymerization. Importantly, we identify dynamical effects that could not be observed through more traditional calculations of bond dissociation energies. Such effects include thermodynamically favorable recovery of aromaticity in the dienone ring that leads to near-barrierless subsequent ether cleavage and hydrogen-bonding effects that stabilize newly formed radicals. Some of the most stable spirodienone fragments that reside at most 1 eV above the reactant structure are formed with only 2 eV barriers for C–C bond cleavage, suggesting key targets for catalyst design to drive targeted depolymerization of lignin.},

 abstract = {Quantum-mechanical/molecular-mechanical (QM/MM) methods are essential to the study of metalloproteins, but the relative importance of sampling and degree of QM treatment in achieving quantitative predictions is poorly understood. We study the relative magnitude of configurational and QM-region sensitivity of energetic and electronic properties in a representative Zn2+ metal binding site of a DNA methyltransferase. To quantify property variations, we analyze snapshots extracted from 250 ns of molecular dynamics simulation. To understand the degree of QM-region sensitivity, we perform analysis using QM regions ranging from a minimal 49-atom region consisting only of the Zn2+ metal and its four coordinating Cys residues up to a 628-atom QM region that includes residues within 12 Å of the metal center. Over the configurations sampled, we observe that illustrative properties (e.g., rigid Zn2+ removal energy) exhibit large fluctuations that are well captured with even minimal QM regions. Nevertheless, for both energetic and electronic properties, we observe a slow approach to asymptotic limits with similarly large changes in absolute values that converge only with larger (ca. 300-atom) QM region sizes. For the smaller QM regions, the electronic description of Zn2+ binding is incomplete: the metal binds too tightly and is too stabilized by the strong electrostatic potential of MM point charges, and the Zn–S bond covalency is overestimated. Overall, this work suggests that efficient sampling with QM/MM in small QM regions is an effective method to explore the influence of enzyme structure on target properties. At the same time, accurate descriptions of electronic and energetic properties require a larger QM region than the minimal metal-coordinating residues in order to converge treatment of both metal-local bonding and the overall electrostatic environment.},

 abstract = {Biosynthetic enzyme complexes selectively catalyze challenging chemical transformations, including alkane functionalization (e.g., halogenation of threonine, Thr, by the non-heme iron halogenase SyrB2). However, the role of complex formation in enabling reactivity and guiding selectivity is poorly understood, owing to the challenges associated with obtaining detailed structural information on the dynamically associating protein complexes. Combining over 10 μs of classical molecular dynamics of SyrB2 and the acyl carrier protein SyrB1 with large-scale QM/MM simulation, we investigate the substrate–protein and protein–protein dynamics that give rise to experimentally observed substrate positioning and reactivity trends. We confirm the presence of a hypothesized substrate-delivery channel in SyrB2 through free energy simulations that show channel opening with a low free energy barrier. We identify stabilizing interactions at the SyrB2/SyrB1 interface that are compatible with phosphopantetheine (PPant) delivery of substrate to SyrB2. By sampling metal–substrate distances observed in experimental spectroscopy of native SyrB2/SyrB1-PPant-S-Thr and non-native substrates, we characterize essential protein–substrate interactions that are responsible for substrate positioning, and thus, reactivity. We observe the hydroxyl side chain and terminal amine of the native Thr substrate to form cooperative hydrogen bonds with a single N123 residue in SyrB2. In comparison, non-native substrates that lack the hydroxyl interact more flexibly with the protein and therefore can orient closer to the Fe center, explaining their preferential hydroxylation.},

 abstract = {Nonheme iron halogenases, such as SyrB2, WelO5, and BesD, halogenate unactivated carbon atoms of diverse substrates at ambient conditions with exquisite selectivity seldom matched by nonbiological catalysts. Using experimentally guided molecular dynamics (MD) simulations augmented with multiscale (i.e., quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics) simulations of substrate-bound complexes of BesD and WelO5, we investigate substrate/active-site dynamics that enable selective halogenation. Our simulations reveal that active-site configurational isomerization is necessary in WelO5 to attain a substrate/active-site geometry consistent with its observed chemo- and regioselectivity. Conversely, a slight reorientation of the substrate from its crystal structure position is sufficient to enable regioselective chlorination in BesD without the need to invoke active-site isomerization. We observe very different patterns of substrate–protein interactions for these two enzymes, and we relate the nature of these interactions to the distinct substrates. For BesD, we resolve the uncertainty around the mechanistic relevance of Asn219. Our simulations reveal that the optimum substrate/active-site geometry also outweighs the interactions between the metal-oxo and the protein environment in facilitating the required chemoselectivity in halogenases. Our work highlights how different substrate-dependent strategies are used to accomplish selectivity-promoting proximity in halogenases.},

At present, over 90,000 MOFs have been synthesized and over 500,000 predicted. This raises the question whether a new experimental or predicted structure adds new information. For MOF chemists, the chemical design space is a combination of pore geometry, metal nodes, organic linkers, and functional groups, but at present we do not have a formalism to quantify optimal coverage of chemical design space. In this work, we develop a machine learning method to quantify similarities of MOFs to analyse their chemical diversity. This diversity analysis identifies biases in the databases, and we show that such bias can lead to incorrect conclusions. The developed formalism in this study provides a simple and practical guideline to see whether new structures will have the potential for new insights, or constitute a relatively small variation of existing structures.},

When properties cannot be reliably simulated, large experimental data sets can be used to train ML models.

 abstract = {Transition-metal complexes are attractive targets for the design of catalysts and functional materials. The behavior of the metal–organic bond, while very tunable for achieving target properties, is challenging to predict and necessitates searching a wide and complex space to identify needles in haystacks for target applications. This review will focus on the techniques that make high-throughput search of transition-metal chemical space feasible for the discovery of complexes with desirable properties. The review will cover the development, promise, and limitations of “traditional” computational chemistry (i.e., force field, semiempirical, and density functional theory methods) as it pertains to data generation for inorganic molecular discovery. The review will also discuss the opportunities and limitations in leveraging experimental data sources. We will focus on how advances in statistical modeling, artificial intelligence, multiobjective optimization, and automation accelerate discovery of lead compounds and design rules. The overall objective of this review is to showcase how bringing together advances from diverse areas of computational chemistry and computer science have enabled the rapid uncovering of structure–property relationships in transition-metal chemistry. We aim to highlight how unique considerations in motifs of metal–organic bonding (e.g., variable spin and oxidation state, and bonding strength/nature) set them and their discovery apart from more commonly considered organic molecules. We will also highlight how uncertainty and relative data scarcity in transition-metal chemistry motivate specific developments in machine learning representations, model training, and in computational chemistry. Finally, we will conclude with an outlook of areas of opportunity for the accelerated discovery of transition-metal complexes.},

 abstract = {Metal–oxo moieties are important catalytic intermediates in the selective partial oxidation of hydrocarbons and in water splitting. Stable metal–oxo species have reactive properties that vary depending on the spin state of the metal, complicating the development of structure–property relationships. To overcome these challenges, we train machine-learning (ML) models capable of predicting metal–oxo formation energies across a range of first-row metals, oxidation states, and spin states. Using connectivity-only features tailored for inorganic chemistry as inputs to kernel ridge regression or artificial neural network (ANN) ML models, we achieve good mean absolute errors (4–5 kcal/mol) on set-aside test data across a range of ligand orientations. Analysis of feature importance for oxo formation energy prediction reveals the dominance of nonlocal, electronic ligand properties in contrast to other transition metal complex properties (e.g., spin-state or ionization potential). We enumerate the theoretical catalyst space with an ANN, revealing expected trends in oxo formation energetics, such as destabilization of the metal–oxo species with increasing d-filling, as well as exceptions, such as weak correlations with indicators of oxidative stability of the metal in the resting state or unexpected spin-state dependence in reactivity. We carry out uncertainty-aware evolutionary optimization using the ANN to explore a \textgreater37 000 candidate catalyst space. New metal and oxidation state combinations are uncovered and validated with density functional theory (DFT), including counterintuitive oxo formation energies for oxidatively stable complexes. This approach doubles the density of confirmed DFT leads in originally sparsely populated regions of property space, highlighting the potential of ML-model-driven discovery to uncover catalyst design rules and exceptions.},

@article{nandy_newstrategies_2022,
 abstract = { Despite decades of effort, no earth-abundant homogeneous catalysts have been discovered that can selectively oxidize methane to methanol. We exploit active learning to simultaneously optimize methane activation and methanol release calculated with machine learning-accelerated density functional theory in a space of 16 M candidate catalysts including novel macrocycles. By constructing macrocycles from fragments inspired by synthesized compounds, we ensure synthetic realism in our computational search. Our large-scale search reveals that low-spin Fe(II) compounds paired with strong-field (e.g., P or S-coordinating) ligands have among the best energetic tradeoffs between hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) and methanol release. This observation contrasts with prior efforts that have focused on high-spin Fe(II) with weak-field ligands. By decoupling equatorial and axial ligand effects, we determine that negatively charged axial ligands are critical for more rapid release of methanol and that higher-valency metals [i.e., M(III) vs M(II)] are likely to be rate-limited by slow methanol release. With full characterization of barrier heights, we confirm that optimizing for HAT does not lead to large oxo formation barriers. Energetic span analysis reveals designs for an intermediate-spin Mn(II) catalyst and a low-spin Fe(II) catalyst that are predicted to have good turnover frequencies. Our active learning approach to optimize two distinct reaction energies with efficient global optimization is expected to be beneficial for the search of large catalyst spaces where no prior designs have been identified and where linear scaling relationships between reaction energies or barriers may be limited or unknown. },

 abstract = {Machine learning the electronic structure of open shell transition metal complexes presents unique challenges, including robust and automated data set generation. Here, we introduce tools that simplify data acquisition from density functional theory (DFT) and validation of trained machine learning models using the molSimplify automatic design (mAD) workflow. We demonstrate this workflow by training and comparing the performance of LASSO, kernel ridge regression (KRR), and artificial neural network (ANN) models using heuristic, topological revised autocorrelation (RAC) descriptors we have recently introduced for machine learning inorganic chemistry. On a series of open shell transition metal complexes, we evaluate set aside test errors of these models for predicting the HOMO level and HOMO–LUMO gap. The best performing models are ANNs, which show 0.15 and 0.25 eV test set mean absolute errors on the HOMO level and HOMO–LUMO gap, respectively. Poor performing KRR models using the full 153-feature RAC set are improved to nearly the same performance as the ANNs when trained on down-selected subsets of 20–30 features. Analysis of the essential descriptors for HOMO level and HOMO–LUMO gap prediction as well as comparison to subsets previously obtained for other properties reveal the paramount importance of nonlocal, steric properties in determining frontier molecular orbital energetics. We demonstrate our model performance on diverse complexes and in the discovery of molecules with target HOMO–LUMO gaps from a large 15,000 molecule design space in minutes rather than days that full DFT evaluation would require.},

 abstract = {Although the tailored metal active sites and porous architectures of MOFs hold great promise for engineering challenges ranging from gas separations to catalysis, a lack of understanding of how to improve their stability limits their use in practice. To overcome this limitation, we extract thousands of published reports of the key aspects of MOF stability necessary for their practical application: the ability to withstand high temperatures without degrading and the capacity to be activated by removal of solvent molecules. From nearly 4000 manuscripts, we use natural language processing and image analysis to obtain over 2000 solvent-removal stability measures and 3000 thermal degradation temperatures. We analyze the relationships between stability properties and the chemical and geometric structures in this set to identify limits of prior heuristics derived from smaller sets of MOFs. By training predictive machine learning (ML, i.e., Gaussian process and artificial neural network) models to encode the structure–property relationships with graph- and pore-structure-based representations, we are able to make predictions of stability orders of magnitude faster than conventional physics-based modeling or experiment. Interpretation of important features in ML models provides insights that we use to identify strategies to engineer increased stability into typically unstable 3d-transition-metal-containing MOFs that are frequently targeted for catalytic applications. We expect our approach to accelerate the time to discovery of stable, practical MOF materials for a wide range of applications.},

 abstract = {The challenge of activating inert C–H bonds motivates a study of catalysts that draws from what can be accomplished by natural enzymes and translates these advantageous features into transition-metal complex (TMC) and material mimics. Inert C–H bond activation reactivity has been observed in a diverse number of predominantly iron-containing enzymes from the heme-P450s to non-heme iron α-ketoglutarate-dependent enzymes and methane monooxygenases. Computational studies have played a key role in correlating active site variables such as the primary coordination sphere, oxidation state, and spin state to reactivity. TMCs, zeolites, metal organic frameworks (MOFs), and single-atom catalysts (SACs) are synthetic inorganic materials that have been designed to incorporate Fe active sites in analogy to single sites in enzymes. In these systems, computational studies have been essential in supporting spectroscopic assignments and quantifying the effects of the metal-local environment on C–H bond reactivity. High-throughput virtual screening tools that have been widely used for bulk metal catalysis do not readily extend to the single-site inorganic catalysts where metal–ligand bonding and localized d-electrons govern reaction energetics. These localized d-electrons can also necessitate wavefunction theory calculations when density functional theory (DFT) is not sufficiently accurate. Where sufficient computational or experimental data can be gathered, machine learning has helped uncover more general design rules for reactivity or stability. As we continue to investigate metalloprotein active sites, we gain insights that enable us to design stable, active, and selective single-site catalysts. },

 abstract = {The design of selective and active C–H activation catalysts for direct methane-to-methanol conversion is challenging. Bioinspired complexes that form high-valent metal–oxo intermediates capable of hydrogen abstraction and rebound hydroxylation are promising candidates. This promise has made them a target for computational high-throughput screening, typically simplified through the use of linear free energy relationships (LFERs). However, their mid-row transition-metal centers have numerous accessible spin and oxidation states that increase the combinatorial scale of design efforts. Here, we carry out a computational design screen of over 2500 mid-row 3d transition-metal complexes with four metals in numerous spin and oxidation states. We demonstrate the importance of spin/oxidation state in dictating design principles, limiting the generalization of strategies derived for widely studied high-spin Fe(II) catalysts to other metals or spin/oxidation states. Combined assessment of the effect of ligand-field tuning on reaction step energetics and on the identity of the ground state allows us to propose refined design strategies for spin-allowed methane-to-methanol catalysis. We observe weak coupling of energetics and design principles between reaction steps (e.g., oxo formation vs methanol release), meaning that LFERs do not generalize across our larger catalyst set. To rationalize relative reactivity in known catalysts, we instead compute independent reaction energies and propose strategies for further improvements in catalyst design.},

 abstract = {The Mo/W-containing metalloenzyme formate dehydrogenase (FDH) is an efficient and selective natural catalyst that reversibly converts CO2 to formate under ambient conditions. In this study, we investigate the impact of the greater protein environment on the electrostatic potential (ESP) of the active site. To model the enzyme environment, we used a combination of classical molecular dynamics and multiscale quantum-mechanical/molecular-mechanical (QM/MM) simulations. We leverage charge shift analysis to systematically construct QM regions and analyze the electronic environment of the active site by evaluating the degree of charge transfer between the core active site and the protein environment. The contribution of the terminal chalcogen ligand to the ESP of the metal center is substantial and dependent on the chalcogen identity, with similar, less negative ESPs for Se and S terminal chalcogens in comparison to O regardless of whether the metal is Mo or W. The orientation of the sidechains and conformations of the cofactor also affect the ESP, highlighting the importance of sampling dynamic fluctuations in the protein. Overall, our observations suggest that the terminal chalcogen ligand identity plays an important role in the enzymatic activity of FDH, suggesting opportunities for rational bioinspired catalyst design.},

@article{patra_computational_2016,
 abstract = {Catechol O-methyltransferase (COMT) is a SAM- and Mg2+-dependent methyltransferase that regulates neurotransmitters through methylation. Simulations and experiments have identified divergent catecholamine substrate orientations in the COMT active site: molecular dynamics simulations have favored a monodentate coordination of catecholate substrates to the active site Mg2+, and crystal structures instead preserve bidentate coordination along with short (2.65 Å) methyl donor-acceptor distances. We carry out longer dynamics (up to 350 ns) to quantify interconversion between bidentate and monodentate binding poses. We provide a systematic determination of the relative free energy of the monodentate and bidentate structures in order to identify whether structural differences alter the nature of the methyl transfer mechanism and source of enzymatic rate enhancement. We demonstrate that the bidentate and monodentate binding modes are close in energy but separated by a 7 kcal/mol free energy barrier. Analysis of interactions in the two binding modes reveals that the driving force for monodentate catecholate orientations in classical molecular dynamics simulations is derived from stronger electrostatic stabilization afforded by alternate Mg2+ coordination with strongly charged active site carboxylates. Mixed semi-empirical-classical (SQM/MM) substrate C-O distances (2.7 Å) for the bidentate case are in excellent agreement with COMT X-ray crystal structures, as long as charge transfer between the substrates, Mg2+, and surrounding ligands is permitted. SQM/MM free energy barriers for methyl transfer from bidentate and monodentate catecholate configurations are comparable at around 21–22 kcal/mol, in good agreement with experiment (18–19 kcal/mol). Overall, the work suggests that both binding poses are viable for methyl transfer, and accurate descriptions of charge transfer and electrostatics are needed to provide balanced relative barriers when multiple binding poses are accessible, for example in other transferases.},

@article{qi_evaluating_2019,
 abstract = {We investigate unexpectedly short non-covalent distances (\textless85% of the sum of van der Waals radii) in X-ray crystal structures of proteins. We curate over 11 000 high-quality protein crystal structures and an ultra-high-resolution (1.2 Å or better) subset containing \textgreater900 structures. Although our non-covalent distance criterion excludes standard hydrogen bonds known to be essential in protein stability, we observe over 75 000 close contacts (CCs) in the curated protein structures. Analysis of the frequency of amino acids participating in these interactions demonstrates some expected trends (i.e., enrichment of charged Lys, Arg, Asp, and Glu) but also reveals unexpected enhancement of Tyr in such interactions. Nearly all amino acids are observed to form at least one CC with all other amino acids, and most interactions are preserved in the much smaller ultra-high-resolution subset. We quantum-mechanically characterize the interaction energetics of a subset of \textgreater5000 CCs with symmetry-adapted perturbation theory to enable decomposition of interactions. We observe the majority of CCs to be favorable. The shortest favorable non-covalent distances are under 2.2 Å and are very repulsive when characterized with classical force fields. This analysis reveals stabilization by a combination of electrostatic and charge-transfer effects between hydrophobic (i.e., Val, Ile, Leu) amino acids and charged Asp or Glu. We also observe a unique hydrogen-bonding configuration between Tyr and Asn/Gln involving both residues acting simultaneously as hydrogen bond donors and acceptors. This work confirms the importance of first-principles simulation in explaining unexpected geometries in protein crystal structures.},

Analysis of the electron density afforded through these methods can enhance our understanding of how the enzyme environment modulates reactivity at the enzyme active site. From this perspective, tools from conceptual density functional theory to interrogate electron densities can provide added insight into enzyme function. We recently introduced the highly parallelizable Fukui shift analysis (FSA) method, which identifies how frontier states of an active site are altered by the presence of an additional QM residue to identify when QM treatment of a residue is essential as a result of quantum-mechanically affecting the behavior of the active site. We now demonstrate and analyze distance and residue dependence of Fukui function shifts in pairs of residues representing different non-covalent interactions. We also show how the interpretation of the Fukui function as a measure of relative nucleophilicity provides insight into enzymes that carry out SN2 methyl transfer. The FSA method represents a promising approach for the systematic, unbiased determination of quantum mechanical effects in enzymes and for other complex systems that necessitate multi-scale modeling.},

 abstract = {Escalating global water scarcity necessitates high-performance desalination membranes, for which fundamental understanding of structure–property–performance relationships is required. In this study, we comprehensively assess the ionization behavior of nanoporous polyamide selective layers in state-of-the-art nanofiltration (NF) membranes. In these films, residual carboxylic acids and amines influence permeability and selectivity by imparting hydrophilicity and ionizable moieties that can exclude coions. We utilize layered interfacial polymerization to prepare physically and chemically similar selective layers of controlled thickness. We then demonstrate location-dependent ionization of carboxyl groups in NF polyamide films. Specifically, only surface carboxyl groups ionize under neutral pH, whereas interior carboxyl ionization requires pH \textgreater9. Conversely, amine ionization behaves invariably across the film. First-principles simulations reveal that the low permittivity of nanoconfined water drives the anomalous carboxyl ionization behavior. Furthermore, we report that interior carboxyl ionization could improve the water–salt permselectivity of NF membranes over fourfold, suggesting that interior charge density could be an important tool to enhance the selectivity of polyamide membranes. Our findings highlight the influence of nanoconfinement on membrane transport properties and provide enhanced fundamental understanding of ionization that could enable novel membrane design.},

Nevertheless, the extent of coupling in these systems has typically only been studied for classical degrees of freedom. To understand the potential benefit of extending such analysis to the coupling of electronic structure properties, we have carried out extensive semi-empirical quantum mechanical molecular dynamics of two Trp-cage variants. Small differences in the sequence of the two peptides lead to differences in their thermal stability that are revealed through electronic structure coupling analysis. In comparison, we find limited evidence that geometric coupling can distinguish the behavior of the two peptides. We show that Asp1 in the more stable variant shows significantly enhanced coupling to both sequence-adjacent and more sequence-distant residues. Non-nearest-neighbor couplings are stronger in the more stable variant, indicating a network of residues that help stabilize the protein. Our study highlights the complementary benefit of charge coupling analysis to interpret protein structure–function relationships.},

It is shown that nanostructured pseudocapacitive electrodes functionalized with ferrocene-based redox polymers are an attractive platform for the selective sorptive separation of dilute organic anions from strong aqueous and organic electrolyte solutions, and subsequent release of the sorbed ions to a stripping phase through electrochemical control of the specific binding processes. A remarkable degree of selectivity is shown for carboxylates (–COO–), sulfonates (–SO3−), and phosphonates (–PO3−2) over inorganic anions such as PF6− and ClO4− (separation factor \textgreater140 in aqueous and \textgreater3000 in organic systems), and between carboxylates with various substituents, based on differences in electronic structure and density of the adsorbates, beyond size, and charge. Our organometallic redox electrodes are a promising platform for targeting aqueous and organic systems requiring high separation factors and fast throughput, such as in the recovery of value-added products from organic synthesis and isolation of dilute yet highly toxic organic contaminants. The combination of spectroscopic experiments and quantum chemistry sheds light on a selective binding mechanism based on redox-enhanced hydrogen bonding between the cyclopentadienyl ligand and the carboxylate functional group, with broader implications for molecular design, supramolecular recognition, and metallocene catalysis.},

We quantify the thermodynamic favorability of doping, which we identify to be both specific to the sites within the MSC (i.e., interior vs surface) and to the nature of the dopant atom (i.e., smaller Ga(III) vs larger Y(III) or Sc(III)). For isovalent M(III) doping (i.e., Y, Sc, or Ga), we observe stronger sensitivity of the predicted energetics to the ligand binding mode on the surface than to the dopant type. For M(II) (i.e., Zn or Cd) dopants, we show that the binding mode of ligand removed to balance charge during the doping reaction is critical. We observe limited cooperativity with dopants up to moderate concentrations, indicating that rapid single-dopant estimations of favorability from DFT can efficiently guide rational design.},

 abstract = {Determination of ground-state spins of open-shell transition-metal complexes is critical to understanding catalytic and materials properties but also challenging with approximate electronic structure methods. As an alternative approach, we demonstrate how structure alone can be used to guide assignment of ground-state spin from experimentally determined crystal structures of transition-metal complexes. We first identify the limits of distance-based heuristics from distributions of metal–ligand bond lengths of over 2000 unique mononuclear Fe(II)/Fe(III) transition-metal complexes. To overcome these limits, we employ artificial neural networks (ANNs) to predict spin-state-dependent metal–ligand bond lengths and classify experimental ground-state spins based on agreement of experimental structures with the ANN predictions. Although the ANN is trained on hybrid density functional theory data, we exploit the method-insensitivity of geometric properties to enable assignment of ground states for the majority (ca. 80–90%) of structures. We demonstrate the utility of the ANN by data-mining the literature for spin-crossover (SCO) complexes, which have experimentally observed temperature-dependent geometric structure changes, by correctly assigning almost all (\textgreater95%) spin states in the 46 Fe(II) SCO complex set. This approach represents a promising complement to more conventional energy-based spin-state assignment from electronic structure theory at the low cost of a machine learning model.},

These compounds, tBuP(S)A (1, A = C14H10 or anthracene; 59% isol. yield) and HP(S)A (2; 63%), are available through thionation of tBuPA and the new secondary phosphine HPA (5), prepared from Me2NPA and DIBAL-H in 50% yield. Phosphinidene sulfide [tBuP═S] transfer is shown to proceed efficiently from 1 to 2,3-dimethyl-1,3-butadiene to form Diels–Alder product 3 with a zero-order dependence on diene. Platinum complex (Ph3P)2Pt(η2-tBuPS) (4, 47%) is also accessed from 1 and structurally characterized. In contrast, heating parent species 2 (3 h, 135 °C) under vacuum instead produces an insoluble, nonvolatile yellow residual material 6 of composition P2S that displays semiconductor properties with an optical band gap of 2.4 eV. Material 6 obtained in this manner from molecular precursor 2 is in a poorly characterized portion of the phosphorus–sulfur phase diagram and has therefore been subjected to a range of spectroscopic techniques to gain structural insight. X-ray spectroscopic and diffraction techniques, including Raman, XANES, EXAFS, and PDF, reveal 6 to have similarities with related compounds including P4S3, Hittorf’s violet phosphorus. Various possible structures have been explored as well using quantum chemical calculations under the constraint that each phosphorus atom is trivalent with no terminal sulfide groups, and each sulfur atom is divalent. The structural conclusions are supported by data from phosphorus-31 magic angle spinning (MAS) solid state NMR spectroscopy, bolstering the structural comparisons to other phosphorus–sulfur systems while excluding the formulation of P2S as a simple mixture of P4S3 and phosphorus.},

 abstract = { Vanadyl intermediates are frequently used as mimics for the fleeting Fe(IV)═O intermediate in non-heme iron enzymes that catalyze C–H activation. Using density functional theory and correlated wavefunction theory, we investigate the degree to which the electronic structure of vanadium mimics is comparable to that of catalytic iron intermediates. Our calculations reveal crucial structural and energetic differences between vanadyl and ferryl intermediates primarily due to the former having a low-spin ground state and the latter having a high-spin one. This difference in spin state leads to differences in energetics for accessing isomers that confer activity in non-heme hydroxylase and halogenase enzymes. While interconversion between monodentate and bidentate succinate isomers of the key metal-oxo/hydroxo intermediates is energetically favorable for Fe, it is strongly unfavorable in V mimics. Additionally, isomerization of a terminal metal-oxo between an axial and equatorial position is energetically unfavorable for Fe but favorable for V. Analyses of binding strengths of Fe and V intermediates to α-ketoglutarate and succinate co-substrates reveal that both co-substrates bind more strongly to V than to Fe. Given the increasingly frequent use by the biochemistry community of V-based intermediates as mimics, our work highlights the limitations of this approach in studies of non-heme iron enzymes.},

 abstract = {High-throughput computational catalyst studies are typically carried out using density functional theory (DFT) with a single, approximate exchange-correlation functional. In open shell transition metal complexes (TMCs) that are promising for challenging reactions (e.g., C–H activation), the predictive power of DFT has been challenged, and properties are known to be strongly dependent on the admixture of Hartree-Fock (HF) exchange. We carry out a large-scale study of the effect of HF exchange on the predicted catalytic properties of over 1,200 mid-row (i.e., Cr, Mn, Fe, Co) 3d TMCs for direct methane-to-methanol conversion. Reaction energetic sensitivities across this set depend both on the catalytic rearrangement and ligand chemistry of the catalyst. These differences in sensitivities change both the absolute energetics predicted for a catalyst and its relative performance. Previous observations of the poor performance of global linear free energy relationships (LFERs) hold with both semi-local DFT widely employed in heterogeneous catalysis and hybrid DFT. Narrower metal/oxidation/spin-state specific LFERs perform better and are less sensitive to HF exchange than absolute reaction energetics, except in the case of some intermediate/high-spin states. Importantly, the interplay between spin-state dependent reaction energetics and exchange effects on spin-state ordering means that the choice of DFT functional strongly influences whether the minimum energy pathway is spin-conserved. Despite these caveats, LFERs involving catalysts that can be expected to have closed shell intermediates and low-spin ground states retain significant predictive power.},

 abstract = {Hydrogen bonds (HBs) play an essential role in the structure and catalytic action of enzymes, but a complete understanding of HBs in proteins challenges the resolution of modern structural (i.e., X-ray diffraction) techniques and mandates computationally demanding electronic structure methods from correlated wavefunction theory for predictive accuracy. Numerous amino acid sidechains contain functional groups (e.g., hydroxyls in Ser/Thr or Tyr and amides in Asn/Gln) that can act as either HB acceptors or donors (HBA/HBD) and even form simultaneous, ambifunctional HB interactions. To understand the relative energetic benefit of each interaction, we characterize the potential energy surfaces of representative model systems with accurate coupled cluster theory calculations. To reveal the relationship of these energetics to the balance of these interactions in proteins, we curate a set of 4000 HBs, of which \textgreater500 are ambifunctional HBs, in high-resolution protein structures. We show that our model systems accurately predict the favored HB structural properties. Differences are apparent in HBA/HBD preference for aromatic Tyr versus aliphatic Ser/Thr hydroxyls because Tyr forms significantly stronger O–H⋯O HBs than N–H⋯O HBs in contrast to comparable strengths of the two for Ser/Thr. Despite this residue-specific distinction, all models of residue pairs indicate an energetic benefit for simultaneous HBA and HBD interactions in an ambifunctional HB. Although the stabilization is less than the additive maximum due both to geometric constraints and many-body electronic effects, a wide range of ambifunctional HB geometries are more favorable than any single HB interaction.},

 abstract = {Hydrogen fluoride (HF) is a versatile reagent for material remodeling, with applications in self-immolative polymers, remodeled siloxanes, and degradable polymers. The responsive, in situ generation of HF in materials therefore holds promise for new classes of adaptive material systems. Here, we report the mechanochemically coupled generation of HF from 2-methoxy-gem-difluorocyclopropane (MeO-gDFC) mechanophores in polymers. Pulsed ultrasonication of a MeO-gDFC containing polymer leads to one equivalent of HF release per MeO-gDFC activation. The mechanochemical reactivity of MeO-gDFC is quantified by single molecule force spectroscopy, and force-coupled rate constants for ring opening reach ~36 s-1 at a force of ~890 pN, 400 pN lower than is required in dialkyl gDFC mechanophores that lack the methoxy substituent. The SMFS and sonication results suggest that MeO-gDFC is a more efficient mechanophore source of HF than its 2-methoxy-gem-dichlorocyclopropane analog is of HCl, in contrast to expectations based on trends in force-free reactivity. Finally, the HF produced mechanically accelerates the degradation of a copolymer containing both MeO-gDFC (3 mol%) and an HF-cleavable silyl ether (25 mol%). The MeO-gDFC mechanophore thus provides a mechanically coupled mechanism of releasing HF for polymer remodeling pathways that complements previous thermally driven mechanisms.},

@article{wong_designing_2011,
 abstract = {One method for CO2 capture is to dissolve CO2 in water to form carbonic acid. This reaction (CO2+H20→H2CO3(aq)) is remarkably slow but is catalyzed in biological systems by an enzyme called carbonic anhydrase (CA). The catalyzed reaction is diffusion limited and occurs at near neutral pH. The enzyme catalytic center is composed of a Zn(II) ion that is coordinated by 3 histidine residues and an axial water/hydroxyl group. A nucleophilic attack by the hydroxyl group on the CO2 molecule is the first step in the reaction mechanism. Cu(II), Hg(II), Cd(II), Ni(II), Co(II) and Mn(II) can bind the CA binding site and substitute the zinc ion; however, only Co(II) yields rates comparable to Zn(II). Unfortunately, an enzyme, such as carbonic anhydrase, is not amenable for industrial applications where a wide range of physico-chemical conditions exist. Enzymes are vulnerable to large pressures, high temperature, and high ionic strength. Efforts to isolate the key structural features responsible for catalysis led to the development of small-molecule mimetics of the CA catalytic site. These mimetics can, in turn, be used as catalyst for CO2 sequestration. Two of the fastest catalyst are the cyclic molecules: 1, 4, 7, 10-tetraazacyclododedacane and 1, 5, 9-triazacyclododedacane (both complexed with a Zn(II) ion). Nitrogen atoms in these cyclic molecules mimic the imidazole nitrogens of the CA active site. It is possible to examine the energetics of these compounds using transition state theory for the purposes of designing more efficient catalysts. Transition state theory predicts that the reaction rate constant is proportional to exp(−Ea/kT), where Ea denotes the activation energy, k the Boltzmann constant, and T the temperature of the reaction. The activation energy is the energetic cost of forming the reaction transition state from the reactants. Ab initio calculations can yield the activation energy, which can, in principle, be used as a design metric for more efficient catalysts. Using this approach, the difference in kinetic rate constant between the tetra- and tri-aza dodecane catalysts can be determined. Furthermore, the rates of the corresponding Co(II) catalysts were explored. Our data suggests this is a viable method for the design of inorganic small-molecule catalysts.},

 abstract = {Colloidal quantum dots (QDs) exhibit highly desirable size- and shape-dependent properties for applications from electronic devices to imaging. Indium phosphide QDs have emerged as a primary candidate to more toxic CdSe QDs, but production of InP QDs with the desired properties lags behind other QD materials due to a poor understanding of how to tune the growth process. Using high-temperature ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations, we report the first direct observation of early-stage intermediates and subsequent formation of an InP cluster from indium and phosphorus precursors. In our simulations, indium agglomeration precedes formation of In–P bonds. We observe a predominantly intercomplex pathway in which In–P bonds form between one set of precursor copies, and the carboxylate ligand of a second indium precursor in the agglomerated indium abstracts a ligand from the phosphorus precursor. This process produces an indium-rich cluster with structural properties comparable to those in bulk zinc-blende InP crystals. Minimum energy pathway characterization of the AIMD-sampled reaction events confirms these observations and identifies that In–carboxylate dissociation energetics solely determine the barrier along the In–P bond formation pathway, which is lower for intercomplex (13 kcal/mol) than intracomplex (21 kcal/mol) mechanisms. The phosphorus precursor chemistry, on the other hand, controls the thermodynamics of the reaction. Our observations of the different roles of precursors in controlling QD formation strongly suggest that the challenges thus far encountered in InP QD synthesis optimization may be attributed to an overlooked need for a cooperative tuning strategy that simultaneously addresses the chemistry of both indium and phosphorus precursors.},

To fill this gap in understanding, we investigate HypD across multiple time- and length- scales using electronic structure modeling and classical molecular dynamics. We observe that the Hyp substrate protonation state significantly alters both its enzyme-free reactivity and its dynamics within the enzyme active site. Accurate coupled cluster modeling suggests the deprotonated form of Hyp to be the most reactive protonation state for C5–Hpro-S activation. In the protein environment, hydrophobic interactions modulate the positioning of Cys434 radical to enhance the reactivity of C5–Hpro-S abstraction.

This interplay is inherently quantum mechanical and highly dynamic in nature. To directly interrogate the evolving nature of the electronic structure of proteins, we carry out 100-ps-scale ab initio molecular dynamics simulations of three representative small proteins with range-separated hybrid density functional theory. We quantify the nature and length-scale of the coupling of residue-specific charge probability distributions in these proteins. While some nonpolar residues exhibit expectedly narrow charge distributions, most polar and charged residues exhibit broad, multimodal distributions. Even for nonpolar residues, we observe sequence-specific deviations corresponding to charge accumulation or depletion that would be challenging to capture in a fixed charge force field. We quantify the effect of residue–residue interactions on charge distributions first with linear cross-correlations. We then show how additional insight can be gained from evaluating the mutual information of charge distributions. We show that a significant number of residues couple most strongly with residues that are distant in both sequence and space over a range of secondary structures including a-helical, b-sheet, disulfide bridging, and lasso motifs. The mutual information analysis is necessary to capture coupling between some polar and charged residues. These analyses are expected to be broadly useful in understanding the mechanisms of long-range charge transfer in proteins and for determining what interactions require a quantum mechanical description for predictive simulation of enzyme mechanism and protein function.},

Computational modeling provides valuable insight into catalytic mechanism, and the large size of enzymes mandates multi-scale, quantum mechanical-molecular mechanical (QM/MM) simulations. Although QM/MM plays an essential role in balancing simulation cost to enable sampling with the full QM treatment needed to understand electronic structure in enzyme active sites, the relative importance of these two strategies for understanding enzyme mechanism is not well known. We explore challenges in QM/MM for studying the reactivity and stability of three diverse enzymes: i) Mg2+-dependent catechol O-methyltransferase (COMT), ii) radical enzyme choline trimethylamine lyase (CutC), and iii) DNA methyltransferase (DNMT1), which has structural Zn2+ binding sites. In COMT, strong non-covalent interactions lead to long range coupling of electronic structure properties across the active site, but the more isolated nature of the metallocofactor in DNMT1 leads to faster convergence of some properties. We quantify these effects in COMT by computing covariance matrices of by-residue electronic structure properties during dynamics and along the reaction coordinate. In CutC, we observe spontaneous bond cleavage following initiation events, highlighting the importance of sampling and dynamics. We use electronic structure analysis to quantify the relative importance of CHO and OHO non-covalent interactions in imparting reactivity.

 abstract = {Polymers that extend covalently in two dimensions have attracted recent attention as a means of combining the mechanical strength and in-plane energy conduction of conventional two-dimensional (2D) materials with the low densities, synthetic processability, and organic composition of their one-dimensional counterparts. Efforts to date have proven successful in forms that do not allow full realization of these properties, such as polymerization at flat interfaces or fixation of monomers in immobilized lattices. A frequently employed synthetic approach is to introduce microscopic reversibility, at the cost of bond stability, to achieve 2D crystals after extensive error correction. Herein we demonstrate a synthetic route to 2D irreversible polycondensation directly in the solution phase, resulting in covalently bonded 2D polymer platelets that are chemically stable and highly processable. Further fabrication offers highly oriented, free-standing films which exhibit exceptional 2D elastic modulus and yield strength at 50.9 +- 15.0 GPa and 0.976 +- 0.113 GPa, respectively. Platelet alignment is evidenced by polarized photoluminescence centered at 580 and 680 nm from different dipole transitions. This new synthetic route provides opportunities for 2D polymers in applications ranging from composite structures to molecular sieving membranes.},

 abstract = {Enzymatic methyl transfer, catalyzed by catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), is investigated using binding isotope effects (BIEs), time-resolved fluorescence lifetimes, Stokes shifts, and extended graphics processing unit (GPU)-based quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) approaches. The WT enzyme is compared with mutants at Tyr68, a conserved residue that is located behind the reactive sulfur of cofactor. Small (\textgreater1) BIEs are observed for an S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet)-binary and abortive ternary complex containing 8-hydroxyquinoline, and contrast with previously reported inverse (\textless1) kinetic isotope effects (KIEs). Extended GPU-based computational studies of a ternary complex containing catecholate show a clear trend in ground state structures, from noncanonical bond lengths for WT toward solution values with mutants. Structural and dynamical differences that are sensitive to Tyr68 have also been detected using time-resolved Stokes shift measurements and molecular dynamics. These experimental and computational results are discussed in the context of active site compaction that requires an ionization of substrate within the enzyme ternary complex.},

@article{zhao_discovering_2015,
 abstract = {We employ high-temperature ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) as a sampling approach to discover low-energy, semiconducting, indium phosphide nanostructures. Starting from undercoordinated models of InP (e.g., a single layer of InP(111)), rapid rearrangement into a stabilized, higher-coordinate but amorphous cluster is observed across the size range considered (In3P3 to In22P22). These clusters exhibit exponential decrease in energy per atom with system size as effective coordination increases, which we define through distance-cutoff coordination number assignment and partial charge analysis. The sampling approach is robust to initial configuration choice, as consistent results are obtained when alternative crystal models or computationally efficient generation of structures from sequential addition and removal of atoms are employed. This consistency is observed across the 66 structures compared here, and even when as many as five approaches are compared, the average difference in energy per pair of atoms in these structures is only 1.5 kcal/mol at a given system size. Interestingly, the energies of these amorphous clusters are lower than geometry optimized spherical models of bulk InP typically used for simulations of quantum dots. Favorable energetics appear correlated to highly coordinated indium and phosphorus with coordination numbers up to 5 and 7, respectively, as well as formation of phosphorus–phosphorus bonds.},

 abstract = {Indium phosphide quantum dots (QDs) have emerged as a promising candidate to replace more toxic II–VI CdSe QDs, but production of high-quality III–V InP QDs with targeted properties requires a better understanding of their growth. We develop a first-principles-derived model that unifies InP QD formation from isolated precursor and early stage cluster reactions to 1.3 nm magic sized clusters and rationalize experimentally observed properties of full sized \textgreater3 nm QDs. Our first-principles study on realistic QD models reveals large surface-dependent reactivity for all elementary growth process steps, including In-ligand bond cleavage and P precursor addition. These thermodynamic trends correlate well to kinetic properties at all stages of growth, indicating the presence of labile and stable spots on cluster and QD surfaces. Correlation of electronic or geometric properties to energetics identifies surprising sources for these variations: short In···In separation on the surface produces the most reactive sites, at odds with conventional understanding of strain (i.e., separation) in bulk metallic surfaces increasing reactivity and models for ionic II–VI QD growth. These differences are rationalized by the covalent, directional nature of bonding in III–V QDs and explained by bond order metrics derived directly from the In–O bond density. The unique constraints of carboxylate and P precursor bonding to In atoms rationalize why all sizes of InP clusters and QDs are In-rich but become less so as QDs mature. These observations support the development of alternate growth recipes that take into account strong surface-dependence of kinetics as well as the shapes of both In and P precursors to control both kinetics and surface morphology in III–V QDs.},

@article{zhao_global_2016,
 abstract = {Piecewise linearity of the energy with respect to fractional electron removal or addition is a requirement of an electronic structure method that necessitates the presence of a derivative discontinuity at integer electron occupation. Semi-local exchange-correlation (xc) approximations within density functional theory (DFT) fail to reproduce this behavior, giving rise to deviations from linearity with a convex global curvature that is evidence of many-electron, self-interaction error and electron delocalization. Popular functional tuning strategies focus on reproducing piecewise linearity, especially to improve predictions of optical properties. In a divergent approach, Hubbard U-augmented DFT (i.e., DFT+U) treats self-interaction errors by reducing the local curvature of the energy with respect to electron removal or addition from one localized subshell to the surrounding system. Although it has been suggested that DFT+U should simultaneously alleviate global and local curvature in the atomic limit, no detailed study on real systems has been carried out to probe the validity of this statement. In this work, we show when DFT+U should minimize deviations from linearity and demonstrate that a “+U” correction will never worsen the deviation from linearity of the underlying xc approximation. However, we explain varying degrees of efficiency of the approach over 27 octahedral transition metal complexes with respect to transition metal (Sc–Cu) and ligand strength (CO, NH3, and H2O) and investigate select pathological cases where the delocalization error is invisible to DFT+U within an atomic projection framework. Finally, we demonstrate that the global and local curvatures represent different quantities that show opposing behavior with increasing ligand field strength, and we identify where these two may still coincide.},

 abstract = {We present a systematic, first-principles study of the role of elemental identity in determining electronic, energetic, and geometric properties of representative A28B28, A30B30, and A36B36 III–V (A = B, Al, Ga, or In and B = N, P, or As) and II–VI (A = Zn or Cd and B = S or Se) fullerene allotropes. A simple descriptor comprising electronegativity differences and covalent radii captures the relative fullerene stability with respect to a nanoparticle reference, and we demonstrate transferability to group IV A72 (A = C, Si, or Ge) fullerenes. We identify the source of relative stability of the four- and six-membered-ring-containing A36B36 and A28B28 fullerene allotropes to the less stable, five-membered-ring-containing A30B30 allotrope. Relative energies of hydrogen-passivated single ring models explain why the even-membered ring structures are typically more stable than the A30B30 fullerene, despite analogies to the well-known C60 allotrope. The ring strain penalty in the four-membered ring is comparable to or smaller than the nonpolar bond penalty in five-membered rings for some materials, and, more importantly, five-membered rings are more numerous in A30B30 than four-membered rings in A36B36 or A28B28 allotropes. Overall, we demonstrate a path forward for predicting the relative stability of fullerene allotropes and isomers of arbitrary shape, size, and elemental composition.},

@article{zhao_stable_2019,
 abstract = {Approximate, semilocal density functional theory (DFT) suffers from delocalization error that can lead to a paradoxical model of catalytic surfaces that both overbind adsorbates yet are also too stable. We investigate the effect of two widely applied approaches for delocalization error correction, (i) affordable DFT+U (i.e., semilocal DFT augmented with a Hubbard U) and (ii) hybrid functionals with an admixture of Hartree–Fock (HF) exchange, on surface and adsorbate energies across a range of rutile transition metal oxides widely studied for their promise as water-splitting catalysts. We observe strongly row- and period-dependent trends with DFT+U, which increases surface formation energies only in early transition metals (e.g., Ti and V) and decreases adsorbate energies only in later transition metals (e.g., Ir and Pt). Both global and local hybrids destabilize surfaces and reduce adsorbate binding across the periodic table, in agreement with higher-level reference calculations. Density analysis reveals why hybrid functionals correct both quantities, whereas DFT+U does not. We recommend local, range-separated hybrids for the accurate modeling of catalysis in transition metal oxides at only a modest increase in computational cost over semilocal DFT.},

@article{zhao_where_2018,
 abstract = {Approximate density functional theory (DFT) is widely used in chemistry and physics, despite delocalization errors that affect energetic and density properties. DFT+U (i.e., semilocal DFT augmented with a Hubbard U correction) and global hybrid functionals are two commonly employed practical methods to address delocalization error. Recent work demonstrated that in transition-metal complexes both methods localize density away from the metal and onto surrounding ligands, regardless of metal or ligand identity. In this work, we compare density localization trends with DFT+U and global hybrids on a diverse set of 34 transition-metal-containing solids with varying magnetic state, electron configuration and valence shell, and coordinating-atom orbital diffuseness (i.e., O, S, Se). We also study open-framework solids in which the metal is coordinated by molecular ligands, i.e., MCO3, M(OH)2, M(NCNH)2, K3M(CN)6 (M = V–Ni). As in transition-metal complexes, incorporation of Hartree–Fock exchange consistently localizes density away from the metal, but DFT+U exhibits diverging behavior, localizing density (i) onto the metal in low-spin and late transition metals and (ii) away from the metal in other cases in agreement with hybrids. To isolate the effect of the crystal environment, we extract molecular analogues from open-framework transition-metal solids and observe consistent localization of the density away from the metal in all cases with both DFT+U and hybrid exchange. These observations highlight the limited applicability of trends established for functional tuning on transition-metal complexes even to equivalent coordination environments in the solid state.},
